Number of rounds : 4

Number of Test Round  = 1

Number of Interview Rounds = 2

Number of HR Rounds = 1

Round 1 (Online test):

The online test had 2 online questions and around 10 MCQs. The first coding question was about passing a ball in a circle and finding where it ended, The second question was about logical operations (XOR I think). I got partials in both these coding questions. The MCQs were mixed with basic OS questions, debugging, aptitude, and English grammar/speaking. I did not have too much hope after the online round.

Round 2 (Interview 1): 

I was the first candidate for the interviewer. He started off with asking me to introduce myself and went on to go through my resume. He also opened my project and asked a few general questions about it. Later he went on to ask a DSA question. Starting with 1=A, 2=B so on and 27 = AA, 28 = AB so on, find the alphabet representation given a number. I misunderstood the question initially but then later went on to solve it with a stack. He then asked a bunch of general questions like where I see myself in 3 years, my plans for master’s, and my experience with projects and hackathons. I was pretty confident after this round.

  

Round 3(Interview 2):   

The second round started off with a brief intro and he then went on to topics I knew. I was honest and said sorry to some of the topics he asked and then went on to ask a DSA question. The question was to find the largest possible chain from an array of strings where strings form a chain if the last character of a string

matches the first letter of another string. Ex; ring-guy-year-ring form a chain. I started writing the solution immediately but realized that it did not work for many test cases.

He moved on to a puzzle. There were three boxes with the following statements:

Box 1: I have gold,

Box 2: I have gold,

Box 3: Box 2 has gold. There are 2 lies and 1 truth in these statements and only one of the boxes actually had gold. Find out which box actually has gold. This was pretty simple and I answered it. The next question was to find the element that repeated more than n/2 times in an array of n integers. I had to sort it and check for the elements using 2 iterations of binary search. I took some time but I got the answer. He also asked me some basic questions on Inheritance and overriding when I told him that I was familiar with OOPS.

I wasn’t really confident after this round due to the DSA question.

Round 4(Interview 3): 

The interviewer was really nice and did not want to test me on normal DSA and puzzles. He asked me to give a intro and I mentioned that I have been working on DSA. He asked me what all data structures I knew and he was interested in graphs. He asked me to implement a pre-requisite checker for a set of jobs using

graphs. I did not understand why I had to use graphs but he accepted my answer which was using an adjacency matrix. He then gave me a sheet of paper with C code and asked me to find the error. I

did not catch the error exactly but my idea was correct. When he gave me a couple of hints I found out the error, and I feel like he was impressed by this. The next question was on how I would use OOPS to implement a cricket info app. He was expecting a different answer but then moved on to the next

question. He later asked me about my experiences and I feel like he was studying my attitude.

Tips: 

a. I personally felt that the interviewers paid a lot more attention to my attitude and

my honesty. They were really impressed whenever I expressed that I was ready

to learn new things even though I wasn’t aware of certain topics.

b. It’s always better to say NO rather than bluff and not answer questions based on

the topics. Also, it is really important to be thorough with all the skills mentioned

in your resume.

c. PS, it really helps to be strong with DSA and various topics like OS, OOPS, and

the basics of DBMS.

Resources:

    a. Leetcode - I followed a series by Neetcode. It’s important to structure the questions you do and follow some sort of roadmap.

Others

I understand how overwhelming the preparation and interview process can be but it’s important to just hang on and keep trying your best. These interviews often require a combination of luck and preparation. Just keep trying and luck will definitely come by.

ORACLE: Technical Staff Intern

AUTHOR : Arshiya Hafis

Stipend: 1,00,000

Number of rounds : 4

Number of Test Round  = 1

Number of Interview Rounds = 2

Number of HR Rounds = 1

Round 1 (Online test):

The first round was an online test round wherein we were asked 2 coding questions and

around . The first coding question was about passing a ball in a circle and finding where it ended. For others the question was : Given two arrays,to check whether we can convert them in

such a way that the value at corresponding indexes of both the arrays are equal, if we are

allowed toswap values between the two arrays. The easy question was based on

strings.The second question was an easy question which included XOR operation. I got

both these coding questions.next section included several questions on aptitude, grammar ,maths and logical reasoning.

Around 40 students were shortlisted for the role.

Round 2 (Interview 1): 

The second round was an online interview round. My second round lasted for maximum 20 mins. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and went on to my resume. Since my expertise was backend and web development, I had written extensively about it in my resume. And hence fortunately I was asked about it to. He asked what my favourtie programming language was and proceeded to question my knowledge on that. My respnse was python and he asked me questions on random module in python, and then he asked about dictionaries and asked about other data structures in python. Later he proceeded to ask about my projects. I had faired good in explaining what it was about, and was also able to answer any question thrown at me about the frameworks as well. He even asked about my positions held in the college. 

About 13-14 of us got in Round 3

  

Round 3(Interview 2):   

After that I was asked to wait for about 1, 1 and a half hours, and to be really honest I had given up on my interview, thinking that maybe I hadnt made it to the 3rd round. But yup, I waited and they gladly called me for Round 3. In this roung I was asked a programming question on arrays, and my nervousness got the best of me and I couldn’t answer it. But upon telling him that I was stuck, he helped me and we solved it together. Later again my Resume was searched thoroughly and he asked me about my DBMS knowledge and whats the difference between relational and non-relational databases, and about sqlite and about oracledbs and asked about my projects.

About 8-9 of us got in Round 4

Round 4(Interview 3): 

Round 4 was HR round, to which I was asked behavioural question as well as about the current tech trends. I was asked how would I manage a rude boss, and how would I manage a tem mate who wasn’t cooperative. Later he asked me how I manage to stay up to date with the latest trends in Technology and would I be open to learn new softwares 

Tips: 

● Make sure to know your resume well. Do not and I repeat DO NOT write anything you don’t know

about in your resume 

● You don’t have to strong in DSA, you have to know the basics well though. 

● If your DSA isnt strong make sure to be well versed in any other domain, and do state it in your

resume so that your interview would be directed towards that domain. 

● It is not necessary that your interviewer would expect you to know everything, so you can always

say that you don’t know or you need help.

    Number of rounds: 4


	Number of Test Rounds =  1

	Number of Interview Rounds =  4

	Round 1:

The online test consisted of 2 coding questions and around 10 mcq

questions. One of the coding questions was of easy level and the other

was medium level. The medium question was : Given two arrays, we have

to check whether we can convert them in such a way that the value at

corresponding indexes of both the arrays are equal, if we are allowed to

swap values between the two arrays. The easy question was based on

strings. The MCQ questions were aptitude based consisting of distance-

time questions, maths, percentages, etc.

SHORTLISTED:

SERVER TECHNOLOGY: 31

APPS: 25

APPS WAITLIST: 8

        Round 2:

Very chill interview spanning 20 to 30 minutes. I was asked to introduce

myself and he asked me a few follow-up questions. The interview was

centred on my resume and he went through each of my projects, asking

me to explain it. He did not get deep into the technical side of the projects

and just wanted to know how I developed it, and how I planned to improve

it. I was asked an easy coding question: “Given a string of lowercase

letters, find the vowels among them and reverse their order. Eg: hello

becomes holle”. I wrote the answer in python on paper and explained the

logic. He asked me to code it in VSCode on his laptop and run it. At the

end of the interview, he also asked me a few HR questions like how will I

deal with my work if it starts getting repetitive and I don't get new

challenges.

        Round 3: 

This round lasted around 25 minutes and also involved a thorough

discussion of my resume and the technologies I used in building those

projects. SInce I used APIs in my project, I was asked a few questions

about them. He asked me about the different types of APIs, what I knew

about each of them and the types of errors that can occur while using

REST APIs. He also asked me about HTML status codes. I was asked if I

knew JAVA since I did not list it in my resume, and he followed it up with a

few questions on exceptions and threads in JAVA. He asked me an easy

DSA question, to implement a stack using any other data structure. I

implemented it using 2 queues and I had to explain my logic and show how

it works on a few given test cases. We had a long conversation about

working at Oracle, what they do and the skills required at the company. At

the end, I asked him about Oracle Middleware and we talked about it

solely for 5 minutes.

Round 4: 

This was completely an HR round. The interviewer was very chill and the

entire round was more like a conversation. He went through my resume,

asking me about the teams and committees I had been in. He asked me

some situation based HR questions and we discussed a lot on a

hierarchical model within a team. I was asked to give an example of a

technology I would build which would be used in my daily life and also

another one that could be used in any of my non-technical interests. He

asked a few usual HR questions like “ Why Oracle?”, “What do you expect

from the job?”,etc. This round also lasted around 30 minutes.


		

    Tips:

● Research a lot on the company: what they do,what their products are and

prepare a good non- cliche question to ask the interviewer

● Keep conversing with the interviewer. During the interviews, you will enter

a large span of topics which you might not be expected to know in depth

like cloud computing, Cloud services, etc, but having a general idea on it

helps.

● Know your resume inside out. In addition to knowing the technical aspects,

be confident in explaining your project to the interviewer.

● For the assessment tests, practise a few general aptitude questions like

distance-time, simple and compound interests, work done, discounts,etc. A

little practice and you can easily crack all of them.

● Practice interview coding questions on geeksforgeeks (Yes, they do

repeat).
