Round 1:
It was a coding round. It was an onscreen online test on Hackerrank. They asked two coding questions. I don’t remember the questions exactly but both of them were on “Binary Search”. One was about “Priority Queue” & other was about “Upper Bound”. Both of them were easy but I didn’t know the concept of these topics so I did the brute force approach. Using that, I managed to get 7 test cases correct out of 11 in the 1
st
question and 8 test cases correct out of 12 in the 2
nd
question.
Round 2:
It was an interview round. I went to the CCD building to give the interview (as it was made compulsory by them). My interview was at 3 pm but my laptop was not able to connect with CCD wifi.
The person conducting my interview contacted CCD and inquired about my delayed joining, as it was already 3:10.
After so much hard work and changing rooms I manage to join google meet 12 minutes late. She started the interview by introducing herself and then told me to introduce myself. I had written the whole introduction. I spitted that out in front of her. But as I joined late she was a little bit pissed off. So she stopped me and gave me one coding question on hackerrank because I told her in the introduction that I focused on coding. The question’s story was so long and confusing. I read that question twice. After understanding that question I just laughed in my mind cause the question was so easy. I just have to do the sum of all the even indexed elements and odd indexed elements of an array and have to tell which one is bigger. I wrote the code and show her the correct output.
S
he attempted to discuss Web Development with me, but I mentioned that I hadn't fully delved into that subject yet. Consequently, she inquired about the topic I felt at ease discussing at that moment.
As my interview was after 4 days after the result of round 1 got released I revised Object Oriented Programming well. So I told her OOPs. Then she started to ask me questions about OOPS. I managed to answer every question except one which I tried to answer but I was wrong. She corrected me and then she asked me whether I had any questions for her. I said no and she concluded the interview. As there was only one interview round, the result came at night and my name was there in the list.
TIPS :
During the Summer vacation of 2
nd
year do as much coding as you can. Give contests on Codechef, Codeforces. For DSA questions and Dynamic programming questions follow Leetcode and Geeks For Geeks as interviewers ask on these topics more.
By chance, if you get selected for the interview then first prepare a good Introduction that includes your name, birthplace, and school name from where you have completed 10
th
and 12
th
. What extracurricular activities you have done after coming to college? Which curricular activities you have completed in college? Never mention a topic or subject at which you are not good at or you have not studied.  Also, don’t add anything that you don’t know in your resume. Because the interviewer mostly asks about the topics you mention in the introduction or during the interview or topics that are included in your projects and mentioned in your resume. If they ask anything from the resume or topic you mentioned and if you don’t know the answer then it will create a bad impression. And also never ever show off in front of your interviewer if they took this thing in their mind then no one can stop your rejection. And yeah be confident during the interview but not overconfident if you don’t know the answer to any question then just say so, cause there is nothing wrong in that. If you say no then they won’t judge you on that topic and will ask you questions about another topic.

Round 1: Online Test
• The online test was about an hour.
• It consisted of 2 coding questions.
• First question was based on arrays and it was an easy question.
• Second question was based on arrays and priority queues and it was an easy to moderate level question, the question was about the lottery machine having 3 columns (having integer entries) and we have to output the number of ways a person can win the lottery with the given sum (sum of numbers obtained in each column) and there was another set of conditions regarding column entry obtained.
• In my case, i had done the two questions successfully.
• Around 15-20 members were shortlisted for interview.
Round 2: Managerial + HR
• It was about 30 minutes.
• It started with introducing myself and how I ended up in NITC and asked why i chose NITC. • Later asked about the problems faced during corona and later asked to provide some solutions for them, especially about education (like online teaching ).
• Then asked whether I have done a project and I said no. I explained why I don’t have a project on my resume. So make sure that u have one on your resume so that u can kill time by explaining your project.
• She then asked me to describe the IRCTC app and its functionalities and asked about which payment method I will choose and why and the improvements that can be made to the app.
• Asked about pros and cons of a group project and how would i resolve the conflict that arose between group members.
• Asked whether I had knowledge of cloud storage and services and i said no. Then she explained the basic concept of cloud storage and asked questions like how a company will choose a cloud storage provider and what types of cloud storage I will choose that will be in the best interest of the company(like protection,cost etc) and why I chose it.
• Asked why I am willing to join visa and the reason for my interest in joining, and the functions of visa and it ended with a couple of questions from my side.
• It was quite chill overall and the results were announced the next day, a total of 10 members were selected for the internship.
TIPS:
Keep coding throughout the vacation, at least two problems a day from hackerrank or leetcode.  Better if you have a project on your resume it helps to kill time in interviews.  Don’t keep a thing on your resume that you haven’t done or learned.  Better prepare for introducing yourself before the interview.  Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it.  Do some research about the company,its functions, and its motto before going to the interview.  Don’t think they will ask about the company only in the HR round, they might ask in any round(it happened to me in an interview for another company).  Make sure you properly read the job description if given.

Test Round:
There were 2 coding questions and 1 hour time.
1. Longest Work Slot 26 nurses have employee numbers 0 through 25 that map to ids 'a' through ' z '. They work in shifts beginning at time 0, and only one works at a time. When one stops, the next nurse begins immediately. Given the employee numbers and the times at which their shifts end in a 2-D array where each element is [employee number, leave time], find the ID of the nurse with the longest single shift.
2. A foundry in Hackerland makes an alloy out of n different metals. In the manufacturing of an alloy, the composition of each metal is fixed, where the required quantity of the ith metal in preparing 1 unit of the alloy is denoted by composition[i]. The company already has stock[i] units of metal i in their stock. The company has a budget to purchase any of the metals if needed. The cost of ith metal is cost[i] per unit. Find the maximum units of alloys the company can produce by using available stock plus what they can purchase within their budget.
Interview Round:
For me, this was more of an HR round rather than a Technical round. The Technical questions were:
How Memory is allocated for a C++ program
Difference between Static variables and global variables and the scope of those variables
Then there were questions like
● Tell me briefly about yourself?
● Why Visa is the company you should work in?
● What are your strengths and weaknesses? As I didn't have any project in my Resumé the interviewer didn't ask about that.

Round 1 (Test):
This was an Online Assessment conducted on HackerRank.
The duration was 1 hour.
The test had 2 questions of Intermediate level.
Q1:
The first question involved traversing through a 2D matrix, and calculating a    certain sum based on the values in the cells. The solution involved making an algorithm by modifying DFS. I passed 10/15 test cases.
Q2.
For the second question, I was given coordinates of 3 points that form a triangle, and 2 other arbitrary points. I had to find out if the 3 points form a proper triangle, and which of the 2 other points lie inside the triangle. There were a lot of corner cases (because implementing mathematical formulae led to divisions by zeroes and other funky things). I was able to pass 43/50 test cases.
Round 2 (Interview 1):
The interview for interns was only one round. It started with her introducing herself and her role in VISA, and then asking me to tell her about myself, my background, hobbies etc.
She then asked me to describe one of my projects, and asked a few questions about what made me choose this as a project, how I started off, and what I had to learn. She asked me about the Software Development Life Cycle and how I applied it to the project.
Then she asked me how I would design an app like yatra.com for flight bookings, and then asked what I would improve in the existing app.
She then asked me about my views on AI, and my opinions on whether an AI learning from data should have human intervention. We then talked about AI and its shortcomings for a bit.
She then asked me a few generic HR questions:
o
One major strength and weakness of mine.
o
Why VISA? Also, how would hiring me benefit the company?
o
Give an example of you handling a huge responsibility or high pressure and describe how you did it.
o
Give an example where you showcased your collaborative skills.
We then talked for a while casually about generic topics, and then she asked me if I had any questions for her. I asked her about her role in the company that she had mentioned while introducing herself.
After a few hours, we were informed of the results.
Tips:
Tone of conversation
:
Try and match the tone of the interviewer, for example, in my case she was semi-casual from the beginning while we introduced each other, and formal while asking me for technical explanations. I kept my answers in a similar tone to hers.
Projects
:
A general advice for any company would be to prepare a description of your major projects. This should include the language/s used, what you learned before starting it, the stages of development, challenges faced, what you learned after completion, etc.
Others:
After the selection in VISA, the perks and benefits provided for the internship period included everything, including travel both ways, accommodation throughout the internship, reimbursement for all travel costs during the internship, all meals and laundry daily, and so on. So you needn’t worry as much if relocation to a new city was one of your worries.

Round 1:
Coding Round
i. The coding test was conducted on the SHL platform. There were 2 questions to solve within 45
minutes and the questions were pretty easy. There were different sets of questions given out.
ii. The first question in my set was to count the number of occurrences of a particular character in a
given string. For example, if the string is “interviewdiaries” and the given character is ‘d’, then you have
to print how many times ‘d’ occurs in this string.
iii. The second question in my set was to print the alternate sort of a given unsorted array. The alternate
sort of an array is the alternate elements of a sorted array. Essentially all you have to do is to sort the
given unsorted array and then return elements which are at alternate elements. For example, if the
array is [1,9,2,5,7], the answer to return is [1,5,9].
iv.
A total of 15 people were shortlisted for interviews.
Round 2: Coding / Riddle / Technical Interview
i. The interview started off very chill and the interviewer set a very calm tone for the interview by asking
basic questions about myself like my introduction, my background and how my morning had been.
After the introduction was over, she went through my resume and saw that I had three projects listed
there. She went through each of my projects and asked me to explain what they were, how they were
implemented (details regarding tech-stack) and which of the three was my favourite. She asked if I
could show her a running demo of the same, which I could not at the time as I had been using a
different laptop than the one on which my project was ready to run. She then proceeded to ask me
how much I knew about cloud computing but this was not a subject I had yet explored so I told her
that my knowledge in this domain is very primitive and told her the basics of what I knew in the
domain. She then asked me a few HR related questions like why do I want to work at SAP Labs and
what are my plans for the future with respect to career after B. Tech. She then gave me the
opportunity to ask her any questions I had so I took some time to ask her a few questions. The whole
interview round took about 25 minutes.
13 out of the initial 15 were shortlisted for the second round.
Round 3: Technical Interview
This round started off with the interviewer asking me to introduce myself and then to explain my favourite project to him, which was a project built on the Object Oriented Paradigm that could find its place in a bank kiosk, at least that was the idea behind the project. Upon mentioning this, he asked me two questions which could happen in a real world scenario. First, he asked me to assume that my application is on a bank kiosk at a branch and that one feature of the application is not working due to which there are rising accounts of customer dissatisfaction. How would I detect what the issue is? To this I answered that firstly I would analyse all of the customers’ feedback in order to fully understand what the problem faced by them is. Then I would look at which all functionalities are affected by the problem that is being encountered and finally go deep into the specific functions that are causing the error and debug them line by line to see what is going wrong. He was satisfied with this answer and asked me a follow up question, wherein he asked me how I would present this problem to my manager keeping in mind that the manager need not know the in-depth workings of the code, he only needs to know what the problem is very briefly. To this I answered that I would first carry out all the steps I mentioned in my previous answer by myself to find the exact issue. Then while reporting to my manager I would keep it clear and concise and tell him that the customers have complained regarding a certain issue after which a thorough investigation was done into the problem. This revealed that the problem is with so and so functionality and my team and I believe that this(a proposed solution) could be the fix for the issue. I would also reassure him that the fix will be implemented ASAP and let him know of the team’s progress. He was very satisfied with this answer. This round concluded very quickly as my interviewer had another meeting to attend on short notice but since I’d given answers that he was happy with it.
I was one of 8 people to be shortlisted to the next round.
Round 4:
Technical Interview
i. This was my longest interview round and it was conducted by one of the VPs. The interviewer was super friendly and set a very chill atmosphere for the entirety of the round. In fact, in the beginning, after my introduction he asked me what all questions I’d been asked so far and upon hearing it all he joked that my managerial round was over in the last two rounds and that he was going to take my technical round.He then told me to explain one of my projects to him in a reasonably detailed manner and that he would pick up something from my explanation. I picked the same bank kiosk project and explained it to him. Right off the bat he asked me what is unique about my project to which I replied that this is a project to showcase my coding skills using object oriented programming and that it didn’t necessarily include anything unique. He then asked me what was the toughest part of the project to which I answered - database design. I told him it was hard coming up with a normalized database and deciding what all needs to be stored and in what way. He then asked me if in a real life bank scenario, would more normalization help increase efficiency? I got this answer wrong and he then explained to me why data redundancy is actually beneficial in such large sensitive databases. He also asked me why I chose the tech stack I chose for my project and then talked about his experience with the same tech stack. He then asked me how I would design a dictionary from scratch. The answer he was looking for is a hashmap where you store key-value pairs with the key being a string and the value being some sort of a list that contains the meaning of the given word. I started off by saying we could store a mapping of the given word and an array of strings, which would store each meaning of the word. But since this won’t be space efficient I upgraded my solution to replace the array of strings by a linked list of strings, so that each node is one meaning to the given word. This approach also solves the hashmap collision issue by using the chaining mechanism. He then asked me how I would map a string, because a normal mapping is from a number as the key and here I am trying to use a string as a key. I replied saying that I would develop a hashing mechanism, for example, by adding all the ASCII values of each character of the string and use that as the key instead. The next question he asked me was to retrieve the second highest salary from a given table of employee details (https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/ ). I explained to him the functionality of the LIMIT and OFFSET keywords and then told him the MySQL code for the same. He asked me to come up with another approach to solving this question so I suggested sorting the entire salary column in descending order and selecting the second value. He said that this solution would work but if there are over one million entries in this table, then to find one value we have to sort the entire table. He wanted me to come up with one more approach and gave me a hint of using aggregate functions. I knew it was something to do with the max function but I didn’t quite string it together on the spot. I told him a solution I had which was to first find the max salary from the entire table and temporarily remove that tuple from the table, then run the max function on the salary column once more. This would be the required value and then we re-insert the deleted tuple back into the table. But this approach has too much of a risk in case the user forgets to re-insert the tuple into the table. He tried to push me to an answer but I couldn’t get it at the time. Just before he moved onto the next question I asked him for the solution to this question and he replied with the nested queries with max function approach (
https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/solutions/3480126/easy-to-understand/
). Finally he asked me if I had any questions for him
and I took the next 15 or so minutes to ask him several questions regarding his line of work and the company itself.
7 out of 8 people were shortlisted for the HR round after this round.
Round 5(HR Round):
The interviewer introduced herself and then asked me to introduce myself after which she asked me why I wanted to work at SAP. She’d asked me why I don’t have an internship section in my resume to which I replied that I didn’t get an internship in my third year which is why I spent the last few months upskilling and working on myself. I made it a point that being able to sit for the interviews was a testament to my hard work. She seemed satisfied with this answer and then asked me if I’d attended the pre-placement talk the day before. I replied saying that I had attended it and that I remembered her talk in the event as well. She said that she’d ask me some questions related to the PPT and firstly asked me how the PPT was and how they could improve on it. She then asked if I had any job location or job role preference. After this I got to ask a few questions and then the round concluded. Finally 5 out of 7 were selected for the job.
TIPS:
a. For the coding round, try to get the most optimized solution in the shortest time possible. Do not spend all 45 minutes on your test if the questions are very straightforward. SAP usually shortlists based on time taken to solve questions and how optimized your solution is.
b. Make sure you know your projects inside out.
c. Be very confident in what you say if you know what you’re saying. Confidence is key.
d. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” when you don’t know the answer to something.
e. Always keep questions about the company ready to ask the interviewer at the end of each round. This shows your interest to work for the company and it boosts your case massively.

Round 1: Coding Round
They asked 2 coding questions (Both were very easy and solvable in 5 mins)
(1) Sort first k elements in ascending and rest in descending
(2) Count certain number of elements in an array
Round 2: Coding / Riddle / Technical Interview
They asked 1 or 2 Coding questions straight away and asked some aptitude questions along with OOPS.
(1) Coding Round Medium question was Kadane’s algorithm (Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray)
(2) Some question related to max-heaps
(3) Few aptitude questions from GFG ( rat poisoning and horse racing, gold brick cutting etc..)
(4) OOPS Concepts, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.
(5) Resume, if you have projects, the interviewer may ask about them. My interviewer was impressed with my work and asked some oops concepts I used in one of the projects mentioned in my resume.
Feedback was great as I almost solved coding questions and got all aptitude questions ( some partially ). I showed the will to learn when the interviewer was ready to give hints and this was well taken.
Round 3: Technical Interview
About the questions asked
(1) Interviewer mainly focussed on OOPs ( same concepts as in Round 2 ) and my resume.
(2) Presentation skills (although subtly) about your projects along with OOPS theory was checked.
Feedback was positive and they were satisfied with all the questions asked
Round 4: HR Round
Asked about personality and background. No particular feedback was hinted at by the interviewer.
TIPS:
Revise coding problems which you solved. For me I had solved Kadane's algorithm problem but there was some small tweak which I forgot at the moment. My approach was well explained and the interviewer understood I had the right idea. In order to avoid situations like these, always update these tricks or tweaks in a notebook after you solve a coding question and revise them properly.
Be thorough with OOPs. You don't need to be skilled with an OOPs language but know the basics well.
Go through all riddles in GFG.
SAP generally asks array based problems more.
Do ask for feedback.

Round 1:
Online Test
There were two coding questions to solve in 1 hour.
The question was like array type questions in Leetcode.
Everyone attending the test had a different set of questions but all easy types.
The main point is to solve them in the most efficient way or to find the solution with the lowest time complexity. There will be a lot of candidates who solve both questions, but it is important to do it with the best time complexity.
34 people were shortlisted for the next rounds.
Round 2: Technical Interview
It was a technical interview for about 20 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. o Interview began with a rundown of the resume. Have at least one good project in it. A few questions were asked regarding my project.
Basic OOP concepts were asked.
I was asked to write a code snippet showcasing the inheritance property.
Around 20 advanced to the next round.
Round 3: Technical Interview
This was another technical interview for 30 minutes.
Questions were about OOP concepts, DBMS, OS.
Two of them were output-type questions to test operator associativity and precedence.
One coding question. The question I got was just to write a simple program to reverse a string.
Overall harder round than the first but still relatively easy if you know the theory portions.
Round 4 – HR
This was a typical HR round for 5 minutes.
Two questions were asked on interest in Computer Science, goal, and motivation.
Do not ignore this round, not everyone who got shortlisted for the HR round was selected.
9 people were finally selected.
TIPS:
Start with the basics.
Be thorough with the precedence of operator and associativity (they may vary in various programming languages, so have a basic idea of that in multiple languages).
Do lots of coding questions on your preferred platform.
Brush up on the company before any interview. Having a basic idea of what the company does and people at its leading positions.
Do not cram your resume with unnecessary stuff. You must have a complete idea of the details in your resume.

Round 1:
2 easy-medium hacker rank questions on an online platform.
Round 2:
This was the first technical round. The interviewer was pretty friendly. She made sure I wasn't tensed and made me feel comfortable asking a few questions about my day. Then she went on to coding questions. It was a pretty easy question from leetcode which I had to code live. After the coding question, we had a great conversation where we asked each other questions. She asked me questions based on my resume and I was also given time to ask her any questions I had.
Round 3:
This was the final technical interview. The interviewer asked me questions on OOPS and I had to explain the concepts with examples. Then I was posed with questions on sorting algorithms and a few other easy technical questions. Here I was asked about my projects, I had done projects on data science and ML, and she asked me to explain a few concepts on the same topics. She also asked me about how I had used any of these skills in my daily life. So I basically had to describe a situation where I put these skills into practical use. Finally, I was given an opportunity to ask any questions to the interviewer.
HR round:
Here it was basic questions about my co-curricular activities that I had mentioned in my resume. Questions based on relocation were also asked.
TIPS:
It is very important to have a well written one page resume.
Explore various fields in computer science, find something that interests you, and work on a few projects on the same.

Coding Round:
Consisted of the 3 coding questions given below:
i. Given two 2-D arrays, find the longest subarray common to both
arrays.
ii. Find out the number of frogs alive on a given day based on the
average frog’s reproduction rate and their life expectancy.
iii. Given two arrays, find the minimum number of swaps required
to make the first array strictly increasing using only the elements
of the second.
Number of Candidates shortlisted: 5 (The criteria was most likely to solve at least 2 questions
completely)
Interview Rounds:
2. Interview Rounds: The interview rounds consisted of 2 rounds, a technical round and an HR round.
i.
Technical Round
: The technical round began with the following 2 coding questions:
Given a binary search tree, find the minimum path sum of all the root-to-leaf paths and, Given a 2-D array filled with 0’s and 1’s, find if it is possible to reach the end of the array passing only through the cells having value 1. As I was coding, the interviewers would also ask questions regarding the logic behind the program or whether further optimisations could be made. The coding section was followed by a theoretical round wherein several questions were asked regarding Object Oriented Programming. Some of the questions asked include: listing examples of OOP languages, stating their advantages and listing/explaining any of its principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, etc.)
ii.
HR Round
: The HR Round consisted of several questions, be it technical (no coding required) or
behavioural. Some of the question asked during this round are as follows:
A General Introduction Background in Programming Technical Knowledge of OOPs (I was asked
about Multiple and Multi-Level Inheritance) Details regarding any Projects completed such as
team or individual, tech stacks used, time taken to complete, etc. With regards to a team:
Describe someone in/something about the team that inspired you, how your teammates would
describe you, your role in the team.
Regarding yourself: General interests/hobbies, performance in school/participation in quizzes,   how  you would describe yourself, what you would if do if faced with a job that didn’t align with your interests Wrapping up: Anything you haven’t told them yet and whether there were any questions from your side.
TIPS
:
Practice competitive coding consistently. While this may vary from person to person, I found the initial coding assessments to be the hardest part of the overall procedure.
Additionally, since questions involving OOPs are asked during every round, knowledge of OOPs theory is essential. Just coding on an OOPs language may not provide the necessary information at the basic level.
Naturally, it also helps to stay calm and composed during the interview, both in terms of presentation and to maintain a clear frame of mind.
To a certain extent, it may also be beneficial to admit to not knowing something you aren’t sure of (for some theoretical concepts).
Coding practice: DSA Sheets, any coding platform (I mainly used Leetcode)
General Knowledge: Mostly GeeksforGeeks
Additional skills (eg: App Development): Mainly YouTube, an online course may also help (from Coursera, Udemy or the like)

Coding Round:
The coding round was held on HackerRank. It consisted of 3 DSA problems and was 100 minutes long. The problems were:
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1527/B1
(The only change was that the given string might not have any ‘0’.)
There are 2 arrays, price, and profit, both having n non-negative integers. price[i] = price of i
th
stock. profit[i] = profit of i
th
stock. You have k days (k may be greater or smaller or equal to n). Initially, you have f funds. At the start of each day, you can buy any 1 stock, and at the start of the next day (before purchasing stock), its profit gets added to your funds (if you have f funds and buy i
th
stock, the next day your funds will be f + profit[i]).  You can buy each stock only once. What will be the maximum funds you can have after k days (start of (k + 1)
th
day)?
You are given a string. Unjumble the string to form spellings of digits (‘zero’, ‘one’, ‘two’, …., ‘nine’). Find the sum of all the digits. (Similar to:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digits-whose-alphabetic-representations-are-jumbled-in-a-given-string/
. The only difference is in the end you have to find the sum of all digits of the number).
I think all who were able to do any 2 complete + 3
rd
partially were advanced (13 people).
Interview Rounds:
Round 1 (Technical Interview, 35 min):
The round began with a quick exchange of introductions. This was followed by a DSA coding question. A HackerRank link was given where I was asked to code. The question:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-array-wave-form-2/
. I began by explaining the approach with sorting and then I coded it. Then I was asked to optimize the code, so I started coming up with the second approach mentioned in the link and finally coded that too. After this, the interview shifted to OOPS. I was asked to write a class Book and then was asked, “If some end-user would like to search a Book in a database/list of Books, they might want to search either by price, title, or some attribute, so write a function that searches the database with the price or title.” I didn’t get the question initially and struggled in understanding what I am being asked to do, so finally the interviewer wrote in the editor, the function signature of function ‘search’ which takes price as a parameter, and asked me to write a similar function signature with parameter title. Finally, I understood and did that and gave a brief description of polymorphism and function overloading. The round ended with them asking me if I had any questions for them.
Round 2 (Technical Interview, ~45 min):
The round began with a quick exchange of introductions. I was sent a HackerRank link to a virtual whiteboard. I mentioned all the data structures taught in college, upon being asked. Then I was asked to explain the structures of Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, and Heap. After that, the interview shifted to OOPS theory. I was asked to explain what all I know about OOPS. I was able to explain compile-time polymorphism (function and operator overloading), and encapsulation. I wasn’t able to recall what data abstraction is, and couldn’t recall what the 4
th
feature was. After this, I was given 2 minutes to read a DSA coding question. I explained the approach to it quickly and then coded it. I was asked to run it with tests and it cleared all the test cases. Then I was asked to explain the code line by line and how it handles the corner cases. I did that. In the end, they just asked me if I knew what design patterns are to which I responded with I don’t know and again the interview ended with them asking if I had any questions for them.
Round 3 (HR Interview, ~30min):
This round was taken by some senior executive and was just like a general conversation. Nothing was asked about Salesforce or from the Job Description. I was asked about my family, how will I travel to college (I was at home at the time), what makes me unique, what did the pandemic teach you, give an overview of my last 2 years at college, my club (I mentioned it in resume), what advice would I give to my juniors, etc and again finally the interview ended with them asking if I had any questions for them.
Tips for Interview Rounds:
Coding round as well as the technical interview expects you to be well-versed in DSA. This includes coming up with an approach and implementing it all the way through in a time-bound manner. Strong DSA and logic-building foundations can only be built with regular practice.
You should know basic OOPS well in theory as well as implementation. So of course, you would need to know an Object – Oriented Programming Language like C++ or Java.
Think out loud. You should explain your approach to the interviewer while you are coming up with it also. You should be able to clearly and effectively communicate your logic. While practicing DSA for interview prep, think about how you would explain the answer too.
TIPS
:
Topics to focus on:  DSA, OOPS
Walk the interviewer through the problem you are solving. They are interested not in just seeing whether you can solve the questions or not, but in knowing your thought process as well.
After the interviewer gives you the question, repeat the question to them, to avoid any misinterpretation. Otherwise, you might be solving some other question itself.
If you don’t know a topic taught in a later semester, you can simply say you don’t know as it has not been taught.
Be confident.

It was an online test. Aptitude test ( 30 questions ) + Technical test ( 30 questions ). Test difficulty level is from easy to moderate. You should be thorough theoretically to answer the technical questions.
Round 2:
It was an online interview with 2-3 panel members.
Introduction about yourself ( Try to be precise and on point )
Which language you are comfortable with?
Coding question ( medium level ) - brute force approach - optimized solution - time complexities
Questions on the project (if done)
Questions on OS, DBMS, SQL, OOPS. (Even if you do not mention 1 them in your resume)
What domain interests you? - Questions on that domain based on your answer. (I told AI - RPA)
Questions on skills and hobbies you have mentioned in your resume.
Why John Deere?
TIPS:
Skills you learned out of your interest apart from the curriculum gives you an upper edge.

Test Round with and 2 Coding Questions. Both questions were sort of easy logical questions.
Round 2 (Group Discussion):
After clearing the coding round, the 14 of us were put together in a meeting to have a group discussion. The topic was ‘How the corona pandemic has affected technology?'. Each of us was asked to share our views and once everyone completed, we were asked to discuss among ourselves. Try to initiate conversation and try to add more key points. 2 were selected from this round.
Round 3 (HR Round):
They first asked about my location preference. I replied Bangalore. The interview was pretty resume based. I was a part of IPF technical teams and worked on developing a MUN website. I mentioned the same in my resume. So they proceeded to ask me about my experiences within the team, the challenges I faced during the process, how I overcame them, and the valuable outcomes I earned. I elaborated on these topics in a technical language.
TIPS:
Try not to stutter during the GD.
Speak boldly and confidently even if what you are about to say makes zero sense.
Try to initiate conversations.
In the HR round, try not to bluff because they come up with questions that really test the integrity of the things that you claim to possess

Q2.
Similar to
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-subarrays-having-an-equal-count-of-0s-and-1s-segregated/
After looking at the question, I could not even understand the question. He was cool and asked me to explain the question to him first. I explained it to him by taking sample test cases and I was struck with a naive approach. As the time was running short, he gave me hints to solve the question with an efficient approach. He was checking my ability to approach the problem and the underlying pattern to solve the problem. After many hints, I concluded the approach, implemented it, and passed 2 test cases. He interrupted in between and told me to reduce the complexity by giving another hint. I implemented it in 2 minutes and ran all test cases. He asked me if I had any questions to ask him. I asked about his experience at cashfree and opportunities for the freshers.
Total of 10 students got shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3 (CS Fundamentals - Duration 1hr):
The interview happened on the Hackerrank website. The interviewer introduced himself and confirmed whether I am comfortable with CS fundamentals. After my introduction, he asked me to explain the TCP/IP model, by writing each of the layers and its functionalities on the Hackerank text editor. This discussion lasted for 20 minutes and he asked the difference between TCP and UDP, DNS, HTTP and HTTPS. He then gave a SQL query to print employee id, count their commits and non-commits (work row contains: commit(1), non-commits(0)) for each employee in ascending order from a given table which contains more rows for each employee id. The question is similar to:
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql-query-to-count-the-number-of-0s-and-1s-from-a-table-column-and-display-them-in-two-columns
I explained the query and my approach first. Then I coded the query and passed all test cases in a single run.
After that, he gave a question from page replacement algorithms similar to:
https://mycareerwise.com/content/gate-question-on-lru/content/exam/gate/computer-science
Before solving the question, he asked me to explain cache and other related algorithms. He asked me to draw the frames table and explain each step to determine the number of page faults.
He gave me another question from scheduling algorithms which is similar to:
https://examradar.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling-algorithms-questions-answers/
Before solving the above question, he asked me to explain the types of scheduling algorithms, the difference between preemption and non-preemption and fill the table by calculating CT, TAT, WT, AVG WT.
Next, he asked me to explain and write the steps when we type
“www.google.com”
in a web browser.
He concluded and asked me if I had any questions to ask him. I asked him about the current projects in which they are working on and the technologies to learn for the role.
Total of 7 students got shortlisted for the next round.
Round 4 (Managerial - Duration: 30min):
The interview happened on Google Meet. The interviewer introduced himself and told me about the current projects he was leading and the projects he had handled at the company. He asked me to introduce myself and explain about my projects. I was asked about the overall idea and asked why I used MySQL for the database. He also asked me the difference between no SQL and SQL, C and CPP. He then asked my favorite subject from the curriculum and why did I choose that as my favorite subject. He also asked me why we need the implementation of graph algorithms in the curriculum and asked me to explain the current applications behind them.
Total of 4 students got selected for the final round.
Round 5(HR - Duration: 20min):
The interview happened on the google meet. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. He also asked me basic HR questions like
●

This round was conducted on Hackerearth coding platform. The test was for 2 hrs and had 10 MCQs
and 2 coding questions. The MCQs were based on OS, DBMS, DSA and Computer networking. The coding
questions were of medium difficulty level.
The first question was similar to gfg next greater element and the second one was query and
bit manipulation based.
I solved only one coding question full and attempted all the MCQs.
15 people were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2 (Technical Interview):
This round began with the interviewer asking me to introduce myself.
After that, he gave me a situation analysis-based question.
You have a safe house and n spies. You are surrounded by n enemy camps. You have to send one spy to
each enemy camp. How will you represent this considering each enemy camp as a node? Now suppose you
have only one spy what will you do? Give real life examples of n-ary tree and binary tree.
He asked me the time complexities for every answer I told. For this, you need to be thorough with graph and tree data structures.
Then he asked me about graph traversals, their differences, where they are used, and their time complexities.
For this, you have to be thorough with basic graph traversal concepts.
Then he went on to ask me about sorting algorithms. He asked me which sorting algo was the best and explain
why. Then he asked me to explain merge sort with an example explaining each step in a notepad/any IDE.
I used VScode for this round. After that he asked me to explain and write the code for bubble sort and after that          explain bubble sort with the same example as that given for the merge sort.
After that, he started asking me about heap sort and heapify. I told them I couldn't remember everything about
because I never got to use it that much but he was fine with that.
Then he asked about my interest. (In my previous interviews in another company, I mentioned in my resume that
my areas of interest where AI, ML and web dev and so my interviewer asked me in depth questions about ML and        AI but I couldnt answer them because I just knew the basics of AI and ML and told him that I am yet to explore
these areas. He said that if you mention your interests in your resume it is for sure that the person interviewing you will ask questions based on that and that you should be able to deal with whatever is thrown your way. So for this  interview, I removed the interests section from my resume.) I told him this. So he didnt dive deep into those areas.
He then gave me a coding question. You are given an array 1 2 3 4 5 5 and the target sum is 10 find all the  subarrays with target sum as the sum of the subarray. I first gave a brute force O(n^2) solution but he asked me to optimize it applying various constraints he told. Finally I got the optimal solution of O(n) (sliding window) with certain constraints that he told me to apply. He also asked me to give another solution for which I gave an O(nlogn) method. He was satisfied with all my answers.
He gave me another coding question. Given an array 1 5 -1 7 find the number of pairs with sum equal to 6. I gave an O(n) solution making use of hashset. He was satisfied with that as well.
Then he gave three strings cat, tca, act and asked me whats common to them. Come up with an algorithm such that if he gives me cta and atc then those strings should be identified as valid. This question is similar to the Valid
Anagram question in leetcode.
I came up with 2 solutions for this question and told the time and space complexities for them as well.
He asked me whether I had any doubts or questions for him. I asked him about his role when he joined DB and his
current role.
This round took around 45 to 50 mins to finish.
After this round 9 people were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3 (Professional fitment):
The interviewer was the same guy who gave the Pre placement talk. He asked me to give an introduction without mentioning the things I have written in my resume. Then he gave me a coding question to reverse a string meaningfully. Example: "my name is xyz"
The output should be "xyz is name my".
I gave a python one liner solution but he asked me to write the code in C as well. So before starting
the coding part I told him each detail of the solution that I was going to code. He was satisfied with
the explanation itself and therefore told me not to code.
Then he went on to ask me about my project and why I did only one project. My project included OOPS concepts.
So he began asking questions from OOPS.
He asked me the difference between data structures and algorithms and some basic DSAtheory questions.
He then asked whether I attended any previous interviews and why I couldn't crack those interview rounds.
Then he asked me about my extra-curricular activities and the courses that I mentioned in my resume.
He asked me whether I had any doubts or questions for him. I asked about his job role and experience.
(He had already covered this in the PPT but because of the internet issue I couldn't hear it. So attend the PPT thoroughly and take screenshots if necessary.)
I also asked him to explain the projects that I will get to work on if I join their internship team.
This round took around 20 mins to finish.
After this round, 6 people were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 4 (HR):
The interviewer was super chill and I instantly got a positive vibe from her.
She asked me how my previous rounds went and whether I remember the names of the interviewers. I knew the full names of both my interviewers which impressed her. She then asked me why I chose DB. I told her that after attending the ppt it was clear to me that my interests and the company's interest match and that would help me to excel in my career. I also mentioned that I would get a lot of exposure by working on AI, ML-based projects (they mentioned these in the PPT) during the internship period.
So she asked me that if they don't give me projects based on my interest will I still be open to working with
DB? I told her that since I am a fresher, I can never demand the firm to give me a project based on what I want.
I said that I was open to all possibilities.
She asked whether I have heard about DB before this and whether I bothered to google about it. I told her that I came to know about DB when I was going through the interview diaries of NITC and that I knew the CEOs name and the year in which DB was founded. She then asked about my hobbies and my extra-curricular activities and how I stayed positive throughout the covid period. She asked me about which DB value I liked the most and why. She also asked whether I could recollect all the DB values. (The DB values were mentioned in the PPT.) Then she asked me which value I implement the most in my daily life and why. She was very engaging and wanted to know more about me.
This round took around 15 mins to finish.
Finally, 5 people were selected for the internship.
TIPS:
Remember even if you don't get the solution don't remain silent. Ask the interviewer for more details and test cases.
if necessary.
Try to describe what you are going to do before you start coding the solution.
Go through the ppt and take screenshots so that you can go through them before the interviews.
Have proper knowledge about the company and its policies.
Be confident and believe in yourself.

Round 1:
The online round consisted of 10 MCQ questions on OOPS, OS, DBMS and Networking and 2 coding questions.
Round 2:
Firstly, they ask us to introduce ourselves and tell something about ourselves. Basically, the first round was based on our resume. I had a Python project in my resume and I was asked questions about it. Then he asked about the x and o game. Then I was asked about reversing a linked list and binary search. Be careful about what you are putting in your resume because it changes the questions they ask.
Round 3:
Round 2 was a more chill and pro-fit round. I had put a competition which I had participated in with my team of 3 people, so the interviewer mainly asked about that and here also they asked me about my project. So thorough information about the project is necessary.
Round 4:
This was the HR round. Here the interviewer wanted to know about my attitude and what I knew about Deutsche bank. Here they asked about what we remember from the PPT, which location we prefer etc

Round 1:
First one was based on System design and writing api calls in Javascript or TypeScript
The other two DSA questions are as mentioned below
1.Maximum Distance between Frogs
There are n blocks, numbered from 0 to n-1, arranged in a row. a couple of frogs were
sitting together on one block when they had a terrible quarrel. now they want to jump away
from one another so that the distance between them will be as large as possible. the
distance between blocks numbered j and k, where j ≤ k, is computed as k − j 1. the frogs
can only jump up, meaning that they can move from one block to another only if the two
blocks are adjacent and the second block is of the same or greater height as the first. what
is the longest distance that they can possibly create between each other, if they also chose
to sit on the optimal starting block initially?
2.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subarrays-with-average-k/
I could solve the two DSA questions but not the first one.
People selected-7
Round 2 :
Interview.
Mode-Online
Duration-45-50 minutes
It started off with exchange of basic greetings and there were 2 interviewers in the panel .
They tried to make me comfortable. Then I was asked to introduce myself . I specifically asked them if they’d like me to share my screen and go point by point on my resume or explain in general . They were fine with any , I chose to share my screen so nothing gets missed. When it came to projects they
asked me to explain them in detail . I had my GitHub opened already in the next tab and I
explained both my projects to them. While explaining my initial web development project , the asked my if I knew SQL and implemented in the project to which my answer was No . Then they asked me if I knew what HA was in web dev and I again replied with a No . Then I was asked if this project is
hosted to which my answer was once again No. After three No’s they asked me more about the functionality of my part and since the code was in Flask I, was asked about Python and the SMTP protocol which I had implemented. I could answer those questions. I tried to direct the interview towards AI because I was better versed with it also knew the functionalities better.
So they asked me about my chatbot which is meant to write cover letters for you when you
give it your resume. They asked me about the implementation , code , API calls all of
which I could answer.
Then I was asked to open the online IDE for some DSA.
After making me comfortable with the IDE , I was asked a question to find a height of the
binary tree . I used the notepad to represent a tree and went step by step .(This was an advice by one
of my seniors and it did help me explain better since there was no pen and paper).
Then I had to code the same and questions on time complexity were asked. Then they asked me about finding the diameter of the tree. I explained the brute force method first and then discussed optimisations . They were satisfied with my response so didn’t ask me to code it.
Then a few questions about my interests, volunteering , and other activities were
discussed. Then questions like Why would you like to join Amex and What do you know
about Amex were asked. Since my core interests and projects were AI and ML related I was asked what if I dont get the same field to which my response was that I am always open to work and learn new domains.
The interviewers in the end asked basic teamwork related questions and in the end asked
me if I had any questions for them to which I asked about their experience in the company
and the services they work on.
The interview ended on a light note.
5 people got a call for the next round
Round 3:
7 minutes after my first round ended , I got a call for the next round. This time it was just
one interviewer. I introduced myself again in a similar fashion as before . He asked me about my project
and was interested in my AI project more which he said we’d discuss later.
Then I was given this puzzle
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-22-maximum-chocolates/
I explained the answer correctly and then he asked me to code the same .
He asked me about the languages I code in and then about my proficiency in them . There
was a discussion on stacks and queues for a brief period and how many stacks would be
needed to implement a queue.Then we moved to my project which I explained to him.
he asked me if I knew how Chat GPT was trained and how it worked . I explained to him
about RLHF reinforcement learning from human feedback and GPT models.
Later there was continuous questioning on Tokenisers then transformers from which we
moved to GANs and Transformers. Later he asked me about the implementation of
Encoders in general all revolving and based on the answers I had given to him.
Then he asked me if I had any questions for him , I said I had two . I asked him if I’d get to
work in the Data centre in Bangalore (so that I could portray that I knew how the company
works in AI and its applications).
The second question I asked was about his experience and domain and he said he has
been working in building AI services since the last 5 years.
Finally the interview ended after around 35 minutes.
TIPS:
The platform used by Amex is its own platform which does not allow you to see whether
your code passes the hidden test cases or not. Your code gets evaluated only after you
submit the code. Once you submit a question you can’t modify it .
Try to efficiently analyse time complexity and space complexity since the brute force code
might pass the sample cases but not the hidden ones.
Don’t get nervous if you dont know an answer or concept , it is completely fine to be honest about what you know .
Be well versed with your projects and have at least one individual project
Always let the interviewer know what you are thinking , start building the code from scratch, give the brute force solution and then optimise it
You can decide the direction of the interview so make sure you know your strong and weak
points.

Round 1 - Coding test
The primary screening test had 2 coding-related questions. It had a debugging question also.
Round 2 - HR-Coding interview
It was a single panelist interview.
1.
The interview began with introductory questions such as a personal introduction and further questions were based on it. Questions included my coding experience, projects done and concepts, languages interested in, and my future plans.
2.
Inheritance and data encapsulation-related questions were asked.
3.
An array-based question was given on balancing parentheses.
I made a mistake in pasting the question from the Google Meet and went on with it. After carefully explaining my coding process, she prompted me to review my work, enabling me to identify and rectify the error on the spot. At that moment, it felt like I had lost because of that mistake, and there was no talk of any other rounds or chances.
Round 3 - HR Technical Interview
It was again a single interviewer. The interview had been arranged at the last moment and the SPOCS had to call me to inform me that the interviewer was waiting for me to join. I had just filled my plate at the mess when I got the call. It was all panic and rush to open my laptop.
1.
One question pertained to optimizing search on an array of 1000 objects, while another addressed the same task but with only 10 objects. (Binary search vs Linear search, Time complexity)
2.
The final question "Why Amex? "
This interview concluded in less than 10 mins. They were also rushing to conclude the interview.
Do read up on the company before you sit for the interview. Just basic know-how on the various employee policies of the company, how it started, current position, and its motto. (They want to know what aspect of the company made you sit for this interview and not just for the perks of an internship).
TIPS:
Online interviews require good interaction during the interview.
In case they do not start a conversation, take the initiative to randomly ask a question. Do know every detail mentioned in the resume.
Also, the major concepts dealt with in your project.

He asked me about my coding skills and how well I could code. He then started asking me coding questions. He asked about my favorite coding problem and asked me to solve the problem in my own style and then elaborated on the question more.
He also gave me a coding problem and asked me to solve it. (They will assist you in solving the problem, ask for hints)
Stay honest in the interview. If you don’t know the answer just tell them (no worries), and they will help you out. Don't be nervous during the interview.
Round 2 :
It was an HR round.
He asked me many questions related to personal experiences, challenges I faced, etc.
Be prepared for the HR questions and be honest and mindful while answering those kinds of questions.

Round 1:
It was mostly an online coding and mathematical ability round where questions from both sections were asked.
Round 2:
After some of us were shortlisted, we were sent a link where we basically had to play a few games. This was so that they knew if we fit into their company.
Round 3:
This was our first interview round. Since I had projects added to my resume all of the questions asked to me were related to my project. Questions were very simple provided you know exactly what you have done in your project.
Round 4:
This was mainly an HR round where a senior member of the company interacted with us.
The questions were mostly typical HR questions like "Give me an example of how you have worked in a group recently and when there was a problem that occurred you handled it." There were a few questions regarding my projects once again as well.
TIPS:
The best way to escape coding and hardcore technical questions in the interview round is by having projects included in your resume. If you do not have projects then a good understanding of DSA would be necessary.
Resources:
Questions in the coding round were pretty simple so a decent knowledge of DSA will be enough.

Round 1 (Online Test):
There were multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in the evaluation, which tested the knowledge of the candidates on various topics including Aptitude, Operating Systems (OS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), and English Grammar. In addition to these MCQs, there were also two coding questions that were part of the assessment.
One of the coding questions was similar to this:

Another one is related to expression evaluation.
Round 2 (Pymetrics Test):
It is a game-based assessment that evaluates a candidate's cognitive and personality traits to determine job fit. Since it is a game-based assessment, candidates do not need to prepare in advance for this assessment.
Round 3 (Technical Interview):
During my technical interview, I was first asked to introduce myself, followed by a coding challenge to print Fibonacci numbers. The interviewer then asked me to modify the code to handle a scenario where the user inputs non-numeric characters.
Remain calm and clearly express your thought process to succeed in the technical interview, especially when tackling a coding question.
Round 4 (HR Interview):
The interview was easy-going, and the interviewer asked me to talk about myself. Then, she asked some usual questions like "What do you want to do in the future?". Later, she asked if I would feel comfortable working in Bangalore. This made me think I might get the internship.
7 students were eventually selected for this role.

Round 1 (Online Test):
The Hiring Team conducted an On-Campus Test on a Digital Platform. The test
comprised of 5 Sections in total (Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, Grammar, Technical
MCQs, and 2 Coding Questions).
One of the coding questions is similar to this one on geeks for geeks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-distance-between-two-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/
Another question was a relation expression evaluation. The below question is a similar question

Approximately 20 were selected for the further rounds.
Round 2 (Pymetric Test):
This round was not as difficult as the others. Pymetric Test is nothing to be very serious
about, you are judged based on your various capabilities of Decision Making, Quickness, and Fluidity in different situations. It is a game-based assessment and prior preparation is not required. No one was eliminated in this round.
People were shortlisted for the technical round based on their CVs. Approximately 8 were selected for the next round.
Round 3 (Technical Round):
The interview started with the typical HR question
"Introduce Yourself?"
Later a set of questions were asked one the concepts of OOPS, here are a few questions they asked
1) Explain Polymorphism?
2) What is Static?
3) What does the term Virtual mean and where do we use it?
A question related to linked lists was asked:
Detect the presence of a loop in a linked list, if present determine the starting point and remove the loop. I shall share the link to practice the question here
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/
I was asked questions related to STL as I was a C++ coder, few of them were
1) What is the difference between ordered and unordered maps?
2) Why do you use STL?
3) Explain the mechanism used in the sort function of STL?
Later I was asked to explain the project which I was working on.
The interview ended with a HR question:
What would you do if you get a role which you don’t like to work?
Round 4 (HR):
This round started with a typical HR question to introduce myself.
I was asked about my location, and where I was originally from (I was from Hyderabad).
She asked me "Why did you join NITC while having so many nice colleges in Hyderabad?"
I was asked questions about the project which I was working on.
She asked me, Why GE?
7 people were selected in the end.
TIPS:
• Never mention things that are unknown to you in your resume.
• HR related questions can be asked in any round.
• Do not try to outsmart the interviewer, if you do not know anything just say it.
• Go through previous interview experiences in geeks for geeks.

Round 1 (Online Test):
There were two parts to this test. First was an MCQ test in topics like Operating Systems, Database Management, and General Aptitude. The coding test had two questions. One was related to expression evaluation and the other one was on binary trees.
The questions were not hard. Try to solve as many problems as possible on sites like Leetcode, Hackerrank, and have a basic idea of OS and DBMS to prepare for this round.
Round 2 (Pymetrics Test):
This was a game-based assessment where they aim to match each intern with a
role. The game presents certain scenarios and tasks to understand one's approach
towards a problem.
This round was fairly simple and it was not mandatory to complete all the tasks.
Round 3 (Technical Interview):
The interviewer asked me to introduce myself, what programming languages I was comfortable in, and asked whether I had done any projects. I was given a coding problem (Unfortunately I can’t recall the exact problem) and he gave me various modifications to it.
In this round, try to be calm and communicate with the interviewer about your thought process as they are more focused on your approach and technique rather than the code itself.
Round 4 (HR Interview):
It was a typical HR interview. He asked me to introduce myself, asked me my strengths and weaknesses, where I see myself in 5 years.

Round 1: Test round
I
remember around
40 questions
in total.
38 being MCQ and 2 are coding questions
. Don’t attend the coding questions unless you complete the MCQs because they carry more weight than the coding questions. MCQs are based on
Networking
. Have a basic knowledge of network classes, IP addresses, sockets, etc. Coding will be tough and if you are using C, it will take a whole lot of your time. It is better to print some output and get partial marks rather than just avoiding the whole question. It worked for me.
I knew the answer and knew it would take at least one hour to completely code out the solution. So I simply printed a few outputs and got a few test cases passed. Something’s better than nothing.
Round 2: Technical round
An engineer from Cisco would ask you some coding questions and mostly it would be based on pointer-based data structures ( singly-linked lists and binary trees mostly ). We would use Notepad or some other app to demonstrate our thoughts in the form of pseudocode.
Don’t be silent on the outside. Tell them the way you think the code could work even if it is wrong. They would often give some hints and help you. Following indentation practices are well appreciated.
My interviewer was a guy named Manish from Bangalore and he was quite chill and made my day. So, if you get an interviewer who is almost your age it’d be great.
I got 3 questions.
1.
Find the joining point of 2 singly-linked lists. (At some point, they have the same nodes till the end, like a y-tube ). Traverse to the end to find the size and make both equally sized. Now, traverse simultaneously until both pointers are the same.
2.
Reverse a singly linked list ( this is a standard problem ).
3.
Vertically mirror a binary tree ( Use recursive algorithm and change left and right pointers ).
Round 3: M
anagerial rou
nd
He would know your personality, communication fluency, and
group participation skills
(Try to come up with some work you did during Ragam or Tathva or Club programs).
Share your experience from the previous round and some good points about Cisco. Don’t use filler sounds like “Aah” in between. Try reducing that. He would ask which field we are interested in and questions somewhat related. He would ask about classes and inheritance, so it is better to know some basics rather than nothing. Don’t be shy to tell him that you haven’t practically used classes much and why. Communication and group involvement are the main key points they are checking.
Round 4:
HR round
This would be the HR head and he would most probably be tired because he would just go on with the same questionnaire and fill in the necessary details over and over again for all. Why Cisco? Who is its competitor? (It’s Juniper) What are the products of Cisco? What have you heard about Cisco? (Boast about the no.1 work-life balance thing somewhat and some recent news like the CEO changed to Mr.Chuck ).
Tips:
I am interning at Cisco currently and it’s Day 2. Everyone is way more friendly than we expected. Formality is something they hate. They like to be more casual, but the work they do is great. Work would get in between our joyous journey, but they enjoy around 80% of their life. Only 20% of your day would be work, and the salary is good too. Try to be friendly with the interviewer and don’t be over-formal.
They mostly hate it.
So, chill and be prepared, especially to communicate properly in a semi-formal manner.

Number of rounds: 4
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
The online test was about an hour and a half. There were a few aptitude-based questions, some networking questions, and ended with 2 coding problems.  Go through the basics of networking to prepare for this. The two coding questions are of medium level.
Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW
This round was completely technical. It was a one-on-one interview. This round was about 1 hour. The interviewer was not intimidating and it helped reduce stress a lot. He started off easy; the first question was based on storage classes and the types of storage classes and continued to ask some questions on data structures.  Then he moved on to a coding question based on linked list, a simple one and asked me to run that code on a compiler. He gave me enough time to type out the solution. The second question was about removing all occurrences of a character in a given input string. For the third question, he just asked me to write a pseudo algorithm for a double-linked list-based question.
Round 3: SECOND INTERVIEW
This round was mostly managerial with a bit of HR towards the end, again one on one. It started off with him asking me about the projects. This is an important aspect of the interview. But I didn’t have one on my resume. I made sure he knew the reason for this. So make sure that u have one on your resume so that u can kill time by explaining your project. Don’t choose a very complex one, it should be easy to explain it. He didn’t try to see what I knew but tried to see how interested I am in learning new things. He gave me a few scenario’s in the workplace and asked me how would you respond in this given scenario. The interviewer shared his experiences working with the company and that concluded the second part of the interview.
Round 4: FINAL INTERVIEW
This round was almost totally HR, a final wrap-up. He asked me why I would want to join CISCO and Who are the big competitors of CISCO. He asked me about the location preference. It was quite chill overall, just needed to be enterprising and confident. That marked the end of the process. The results were announced later that night.
Tips
:
Keep coding throughout the vacation, one or two problems a day from Hackerrank or Leetcode.
Ensure that you have a project mentioned on your resume.
Prepare the basics of networking.
Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it.
Do some research about the company and its motto before going to the interview.
Others
:
Don’t despair if you don’t get called for a long time. For me, the second round concluded at around 1 pm and had to wait until 7:30 pm for the last round ( a very long 6 hrs gap). Just relax and keep calm. Don’t lose faith when you don’t qualify for the round but keep giving your best for every chance you have got (luck also plays an important factor).

Number of rounds: 4
Selected: 8 (25 passed the coding Round)
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:
The test round consisted of
42 questions
which comprised
Aptitude questions, Networking based questions and some from OOPs, OS and DBMS
. 2 Coding questions based on
graphs
which were hard and I only managed to solve them partially. (I don’t think anyone solved those questions completely)
Round 2:
In the first round of interview, the interviewer was a friendly guy. He started by asking
some basic C++ questions
(like different types of data types and all) as I mentioned in my resume.
Then he proceeded to ask a few DSA questions which is usual in every interview. I didn’t remember all the questions he asked but one of the questions was to
find the longest palindromic substring
.
It would be better if we first solve the question in the interview with a brute force approach and then try to optimize it further. Also while solving the questions, it is important to speak out what you are thinking and how you are approaching the solution to the interviewer.
Then he asked some puzzles and at the end he asked me to explain and implement
AVL tree
. I was surprised that usually such advanced DSA question don’t used to be asked in the interview. I explained to him what is AVL tree and how it works and given the pseudo code and also tried to code for one of the cases of AVL tree and he was satisfied with my answer.
Round 3:
It was basically the HR and Managerial round, he asked some questions based on what I had mentioned in my resume and there was a long discussion on my project.
The questions were not focused on the implementation part, rather he asked me about the difficulties I have faced while doing my project and what improvements/changes could have improved the overall project.
Round 4:
It was also a HR round but nothing much happened. He asked some common HR questions like ‘Why do you want to join Cisco ?’ , ‘Where do you see yourself in next 5 years ?’, ‘Biggest competitor of Cisco’ and in the end he asked about the preferred location.
TIPS:
For interviews, in the beginning, you should introduce yourself and it shouldn’t be too short or too long just precise enough so that the interviewer will get an idea about you and in the end, it would be better if you ask some questions to the interviewer like ‘his/her experience in that firm’ or ‘his/her role in the firm’
It would be better if you have one solid project in your resume, but I didn’t have any such project and only mentioned my club website to which I contributed only some frontend elements. Anyway, it was not a problem for me as Cisco didn’t focus much on projects.
Never lose hope and it is never too late to start. I started my preparation at the end of July when companies started visiting our campus and at first, I also thought it was too late to start preparing for the interview and I would not be able to crack any company. Then I just kept these negative thoughts aside and started preparing for it and in the end, it was worth it. Even if you haven’t done anything in the past 2 years, still you can manage to grab a good offer.
I recommend you to focus on DSA and just theory but also on problem solving as it plays a key role in your interviews

Number of rounds: 4
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:
Test Round with some aptitude (Networking / DBMS / OOPS questions can be expected) and 2 coding questions. Both are based on graphs (Hard) (The question was about adding modems to the office building and other buildings, it's about the least number of modems). I have yet to find anyone to solve either of the questions. I managed to make some test cases pass. For me, 5 test cases passed on both questions, which helped me to qualify for the upcoming rounds.
Round 2:
First Interview Round. He asked several short questions based on DSA and one puzzle. (To find one ball with different weights among many balls with the least amount of tries with weight balance). He also asked which Data Structure is used for Dictionary (Tries). He asked me to code the search algorithm in BST and BT. (He was friendly compared to others from different company interviews).
They asked me to explain any of my projects. I did, and he didn't care much about them(projects).
The Round went well. I asked him about 5G and Cisco's scope (google “Cisco news” to ask something relevant). He told me to ask HR. I requested Tips for further rounds to which he replied "That's not how it works", and wished me luck.
Round 3:
●
HR Round, The HR manager asked so many personal questions, like where do you see yourself in 5 years(Senior engineer at Cisco), ambition, goal in life(parents), and why Cisco? , products from Cisco (some modems from their website and packet tracer), Competition (Junipher, AWS, ZOOM), and some questions like "Hardest point in your life" and "Experiences in overcoming difficult situations in your life". I made up some stories spot-on and impressed him. He also asked about planning for further studies. ( I answered, "In CSE, I don't think there is a need for a master, technology keeps changing. We just need to keep up")
●
He then asked about networks, and asked me to explain TCP and its 3-way Handshaking.
●
I asked him about the COVID situation and how employees at Cisco overcame it. (online, work, home, and other craps)
Round 4:
Nothing Much. Asked me about your interview experience. Is this your first interview? (6th company for me).
He asked about the preferred location. And That's it.
TIPS:
●
C won't help you.
●
DSA is not required to pass the coding round. It helps in an interview.
●
Learn C++ + STL (Standard Template Library) to solve questions if you are familiar with C.
●
Else stick with Python.
●
Neetcode.io solve easy and medium-type questions from this, at least.
●
Many of your Friends won't care about this drive and will eventually lose interest after failing some tests. Don't be that guy. Work hard so that you can secure an internship at a good company and relax for the next two years.
●
(After August/September, good companies will pop up rarely, and the drive will be dry with so many small companies with low stipends, but some companies, like Barclays, came up with a 1 lakh Stipend during December, so it depends on your luck )
●
Learn some basics about Networks and DBMS.
●
Some companies won't give a crap about Projects, while others focus too much on them. Cisco didn't focus much on Projects. So it's always good to have 1 or 2 solid projects. (Companies like Goldman will concentrate on subjects if you don't have any projects, which will make the easy interview more difficult)
●
After each interview round, be prepared with a Question. Google companies name and go to the news tab; you can find relevant info to ask about.

SYSTEMS INTERN
AUTHOR : ARITRO GHOSH
Stipend:
Rs 1,50,000
Number of Rounds:
1 (coding +MCQ ) round and 3 interview rounds
Round 1 (Coding + MCQ Round):
There were 26 questions split into 4 sections.The first section was Computer Fundamentals covering topics like OOPS, Computer Networks, DBMS, and Operating Systems. (In descending order of priority).
The second section contained aptitude and math-based questions like speed-time or work-time problems.
The third section contained system design questions covering topics like CORS, DBMS, etc
The fourth section was a single coding question - Find the number of new arrays you can generate for a given array such that for each 1
<
= new_arr[i]
<
= arr[i] and no number is repeated in the new array. (Easy implementation with medium intuition)
16 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2 (Technical Interview):
This was the first technical round that happened in person. They started by asking me to choose my most important project. I chose one and had to describe it thoroughly. They cross-questioned me based on it. Then they asked me a question based on OOPS and function overriding. Lastly, they asked me a few questions based on Python Interpreters, C/C++ compilers, and Memory management in both languages. I could answer most of them
but not to a proper extent. They would always guide me to the answer they wanted by adding more to the question but would not confirm if I got it correctly. They ended by asking if I wanted to ask a question. I asked how much financial knowledge would be needed to work in the development team of a Fin-Tech company.
Round 3 (HR Round):
This happened immediately after the first technical round. I was asked about my personal aspirations, family life, goals, where I see myself in a few years, and why I want to join the company. The conversation flowed well and there were no difficult questions in this round. She asked me if I had any questions and I asked what opportunities there are as an intern in DE Shaw and what are some things to look out for.
6 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 4 (Technical Interview II):
This was the last round and it took well over an hour for me. They started by asking me to introduce myself. Then they went on to ask me about some DSA algorithms. They asked me which topic was my forte to which I replied with graphs. Then they started asking me which algorithms specifically. So, I described one or two graph algorithms that I had a good grasp over. I explained Kahn’s Algorithm. Then they asked me a question combining MST, shortest path, and computer networks. I was able to come up with a vague solution but nothing
concrete. Then they asked me a few questions based on Kadane’s Algorithm and made me modify it to serve more functionalities. Finally, they asked me to solve some puzzles from GFG. The North-South Pole puzzle was asked. They asked if I had any questions but I was out of questions so I just asked a similar question as the HR round about what to look out for.
Tips:
Solve tons of Leetcode medium-level questions. If you are starting early you can also do some Codeforces or Codechef.
Make sure to learn computer fundamentals properly and know keywords and terms.
While using libraries or modules make sure to have an idea behind their implementations.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, don’t fret to say that.
Speak out all your thoughts openly and make sure to be polite.

Round 1:
Consisted of three sections:
Section 1: English Comprehension/ Verbal Reasoning
Section 2: Business Aptitude - Bar graphs, pie charts etc. with data were
presented to us and we had to interpret them and answer questions accordingly.
Overall not difficult, but time consuming.
Section 3: Coding round - Coding round consisted of 3 questions, 2 of which were very simple, the third
question was of medium level difficulty.
First questions Was to find number of characters in a string
that would remain in the same position
if the string was reversed.
Second question was; Given an
array of size n, consisting of elements from 0 to (n-1), return an
array A where A[i] is the index of ith element in the input array. Example: input array - [3,1,0,2],
output array - [2,1,3,0]. (Because 0 is in the 2nd index, 1 is in 1st index, 2 is in 3rd index and 3 Is in
0th index)
Third question was a greedy problem.
Round 2:
Interview started with both myself and the interviewer introducing ourselves. The Interviewer then asked a DSA question; How would you implement a stack data Structure using the queue data structure. He then followed up with questions based on the answer that i gave (time complexity of push and pop, optimization, etc.). Then the Interviewer asked about coursework that I did, favorite subjects, and then asked Questions based on my resume (projects, languages, frameworks etc.). Also asked a few questions on DBMS (primary key, foreign key etc.) and one question on Non Deterministic Finite Automata
Round 3:
Very similar to the first technical interview. Interviewer asked about my resume, Languages, projects, favorite subjects. Then moved on to DSA questions. Asked me to Explain DFS and BFS, applications of BFS, pseudocode for finding Nth Fibonacci Number.
Round 4(HR Round):
Basic questions expected in an HR interview. Why Wells Fargo, where do you see
Yourselves in five years, etc.
Tips:
Be absolutely thorough with your resume and any projects mentioned in it. You need to
Every single detail and the exact working of the project. Speak confidently, don’t be

Number of Test Rounds  = 1

Number of HR Rounds = 1
Online Test:
The online assessment consisted of three sections, the first one being an English
Aptitude section. This consisted of around 20 MCQ's that tested your understanding of phrases and general comprehension. This was followed by a Business Aptitude section, which tested your ability to
draw info from graphs and tables and make correct assertions. These 20 MCQ's were grouped into batches of 4 or 5 which pertained to the same data. The third and final section was the Coding section, which comprised 3 questions where you code programs using basic DSA.
Two of the questions were simply:
"Find the number of negative elements in the list"and
"Given a number, return a number created from the same digits such that you get the lowest magnitude possible (without leading zeroes)"(Example: 1903 wouldoutput 1039)
20 people were shortlisted for the interview round.
● Technical Interview
The technical interview of mine lasted around 45 minutes, and was taken by a
senior employee who had worked at Wells for 10+ years. I started off with a
friendly introduction, after which he asked me to explain one of my projects. I
proceeded to get into my Web Dev experience as a part of the Tech Teams and
participating in hackathons.
While explaining some backend, he segued into some DBMS, where he
eventually asked me to map out a general scheme for a college management
system. Although we had just started the first week of our new semester and
would be covering DBMS in the following months, I used my experience from
projects to draw up a design he was satisfied with.
He then moved onto my experience with AI, for which I gave a basic overview of
multiple aspects of AI and why I was interested in it. I also ended up giving an in-
depth analysis of the minimax algorithm as it was simple to demonstrate on
paper.
The interviewer was satisfied with me so far and finally decided to give me a DSA
question. It was a simple &quot;Reverse a linked list&quot; question for which I provided the
iterative solution.
The interviewer was happy with the way I had been answering so far, and was
going through my resume and asking a few small questions on things I had
listed. He then decided to wrap things up and gave me a chance to ask
questions. I decided to ask about his experience with the work culture and work-
life balance at Wells, to which he gave me a great answer which I responded
enthusiastically to. A firm handshake and a farewell marked the end of my
technical interview.
HR Interview
The HR interview was around 30 minutes, and was taken by 2 senior employees
who had also spoken at the Pre-Placement Talk.
I once again started off with an introduction, and they kicked off the interview with
"Why Wells Fargo?". I had heard good things from seniors (I was particularly
close with a few who had gotten placed there), and even mentioned the work
culture answer I received from my technical round.
They then asked me some questions on my interests, namely Web Dev, AI, and
Game Dev. I told them my motivations behind pursuing and experimenting with
each of them, and even mentioned some of the projects I had worked on and
what I had learned from them.
They mentioned that while they didn' t have much use for Game Dev (obviously),
there was quite a bit of work done with Web Dev and AI, particularly for their
Online Banking sector. I again responded positively and they moved on to test
me with a DSA question.
This question was just as basic as in the technical round:
"How would you evaluate a mathematical expression given as a string?"
(Program a calculator basically).
I explained my initial set-up and thought process well enough that they just
moved on halfway through my explanation.
They then proceeded to ask the classic &quot;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot;,
to which I answered &quot;Ideally still having a stable job, and a Masters as well if I
decide to pursue it&quot;.
They followed up by questioning what plans I had for Masters, to which I
responded that I was uncertain, but would like to dig deep into AI and be a part of
its rapid development. They then followed the same line of questioning and
asked when I would like to pursue a Postgraduate Degree, and if it was even
essential at all if all I wanted to do was research better ways to use AI.
I had answered them extensively, but there seemed to be a misunderstanding
where they thought I would leave the company to pursue my Masters. After they
confronted me directly about my intentions, I quickly clarified my intent to work in
parallel to studying for a Postgraduate if I ever did. I brought up the plan that they
had talked about in the Wells Fargo PPT that supported employees that wanted
to study further.
After that point was cleared up, they decided to wrap up and offered to answer
questions. I decided to ask them about the domains they mentioned in their PPT
and whether we'd get a chance to peek into them all during our internship. I also
inquired about the branch we'd be assigned to for the internship, and whether
we'd get to work with other students as well. They happily answered my
questions, after which I thanked them for the wonderful interview experience.
8 people were finally selected for the internship.
Tips:
● The Online Test emphasized Aptitude more than DSA. Just be good with general
English Comprehension, and Logic and Data Analysis (Learn to read graphs and
tables well). You should be fine :)
● The technical interview will be dependent on your resume. If you have good
projects they will be willing to ask you about it and allow you to explain what
you've learnt. Otherwise they usually default to DSA questions. (My interviewer
started off by saying that we will mainly be looking at DSA and coding but got
sidetracked pretty much immediately after going through my resume)
● The HR round is basically a formality to see if you'll be a good fit for the
company. Don't answer like a dummy or a psychopath, and you'll get through.
● Be confident in what you know and get your points across clearly. This is hard to
do sometimes so repeat and even clarify points from the interviewers. Be friendly
but professional with the interviewers. Practice answering commonly asked
questions with a friend.
● Try to reference things they might have mentioned before, be it from earlier in the
interview or even during the PPT. This shows them that you've genuinely listened
to them, and are trying to learn/build on top of those ideas or points.
● Always keep a question or two handy to ask the interviewer. They would have
most likely already decided whether to keep you in or not by that point, but it
serves as a good ending note and closes off the interview naturally. On the off
chance they're undecided, it shows you're interested in knowing more about the
company and might help form a good impression.
Resources:
● A good group of friends and seniors who&#39;ll give you feedback as you progress in
your preparation.
● Leetcode for DSA (Personally didn’t use it all that much, but it&#39;s useful to get a
hang of the commonly asked questions (Midcode imo))
● YouTube/Google for anything you want (I basically live on Youtube and watch a
ton of interesting things that I want to look into or try out)

Round 1:
It was mostly based on reasoning(based on graphs, tables, charts, etc.), english and programming. There were three programming questions.
a. The first one was pretty easy map based question. (Though I got stuck due to the
syntax of string stream in C++14. Be careful about which functions you're using
in which version of C++).
b. The next one was again a very simple array based question.
c. The last one was a bit tricky kind of question on sorting/ lexicographic ordering.
The test cases were confusing.
Round 2:
This round was pretty short and the interviewer was quite friendly and conversational. There were no coding questions per se and it was completely resume based. He asked me about literally everything
mentioned in my resumes from my schools, to clubs and associations I'm a part of to the various languages I've mentioned and why. He also asked me about what's the most recent skill I've learnt and also a bit about my project. Some specific questions he asked were:
a. What's the internal implementation of the import statement in python.
b. Difference between arrays and Linked Lists.
c. Various kinds of Operating Systems I used and what made them different from
each other.
d. Difference between Windows and Linux OS.
e. Memory level implementation of Linked Lists.
Round 3:
This was a bit more somber than the previous round. The interviewer asked me to explain to him about my project and asked follow up questions about that. Only one coding question was asked in this round and that was to code up BFS. I wrote the pseudo code and he asked me to explain it to him. He asked me a couple of questions about the algorithm, it's implementation and some specific cases. There were also a couple of behavioral questions as he asked me if I'm always this calm and reserved. Took me a bit by shock, but I managed to answer that. It continued for 5 minutes or so and after that the interview concluded.
Round
4(HR Round)
:
The round started by the HR asking me to speak about my experience, projects, etc. for
5 minutes straight. Asked me a couple of questions about the implementation of my
project and some intricacies on how it differed from Real life systems. Then he moved to
data structures and asked me to tell him about all the data structures I've studied and
which is my favorite one and why. I told him it was hash maps. Then he asked some
further questions.
● What are the applications of stacks in CS. I told him about how stacks are used
in recursion and then we talked about the winding and unwinding phase of
recursion and how tail recursions are optimized by compilers. I told him about
user stacks and kernel stacks in OS and how they are used during context
switches, etc.
● Then he asked me to delineate the differences between single linked lists and
doubly linked lists. He asked me about the applications of doubly linked lists. I
wasn't sure of that so I asked if I could tell about the applications of SLLs. He
asked me to continue and I told him about the applications of SLLs in disk
storage mechanisms and Garbage collections and we talked a bit about memory
fragmentation, etc.
● Then he asked me about my interests and which areas I would like to work in if I
joined the company. We discussed for about 15 minutes about the roles,
aspirations and policies, etc. After that the interview concluded.
Tips:
● Probably the most repeated one, but don't lie on your resume. They literally ask about
everything
from top to bottom on whatever you've mentioned there.
● Try to chill with your interviewer. They're very keen observers of your behavior and being
too calm, composed and reserved might not be the best of choices. Just be yourself.
● Don't sleep during PPTs. After every round they ask if you've any questions and PPTs
are an excellent source for such questions. Listen to what they've to offer and how it
aligns with your interests. It shows you're actually interested in working there which is a
very important factor.
● Don't be afraid of your opinions or interests. Have convincing arguments for them.

Round 1 (Test):
Consisted of three sections:
1)
Verbal Reasoning
2)
Business Aptitude (Graph-based questions on stocks)
(The questions under these sections were not that tough, but time is a deciding factor.
Try to attempt all questions since there is no negative marking for wrong answers.)
3)
2 Coding Questions (Medium Level)
14 students were shortlisted for interview round 1.
Round 2 (Interview 1):
This was a technical round that started with the interviewer’s introduction followed by mine.
I was asked to speak about something new I learned recently, and then there were some simple questions like applications of a 2D array.
The interviewer then asked me about my favorite subject, and I mentioned my interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Subsequently, the interviewer asked me several questions to assess my knowledge of DSA (what is a data structure, the common data
structures used, why should someone learn DSA, circular linked list and its application, heap, AVL tree and its importance, DFS, etc.)
He gave me two short coding questions and asked for their time complexities:
1)
Given the time find the angle (in degree) between the hour hand and the minute hand. (Just had to write the pseudocode)
Input: 9:30
Output: 90
Input: 8:40
Output: 0
2)
Reverse the string without affecting the special characters.
https://www.geeksfor
geeks.or
g/reverse-a-string-without-affecting-special-characters/
(Had to code in front and show the output)
Input: He%$llo!
Output: ol%$leH!
He wanted to ask me questions on networking, but since I hadn’t learned about it yet, he did not proceed to ask more about it. After a few questions on STL and OOPS, he asked me if I had any questions for him, and then ended the meeting.
Before asking questions on any of the topics, my interviewer was considerate enough to ask me if I knew about it and then only proceeded with the questions. So, if you don't know about a topic don't be tense, just be cool and tell them that you're yet to learn about it. They don't
expect you to know everything. Just say what you know with full confidence.
7 students were
shortlisted
for interview 2.
Round 3 (Interview 2):
This round was primarily based on my resume and the projects I mentioned. No coding questions were asked.
He asked me some basic HR questions like what I knew about the company.
My interviewer was so chill that I felt like we were just having a fun convo. I didn't have great projects in my resume, just some small ones. But he was so optimistic to give good comments about them too. We discussed about all my projects, and then my thoughts on teamwork.
We had faced network issues for some time. When it was resolved, he asked me if I had any ideas on how to run smoothly these online interviews and meetings in case of such network issues.
In the end, he asked me if I had any questions for him. Be prepared with some questions to be asked at this time. It should make them feel that you are really interested in the company.
This was the final round and 4 students got selected for the internship.
TIPS:
Speak to them confidently and openly. Let them know that you are employable in any environment and that you are fit for their company. I believe that beyond just technical knowledge, your attitude matters a lot.

Round 1:
The first round was conducted on the AMCAT platform. The test included 2 coding questions, and MCQs on Logical thinking and analytics, general computer science questions, and English aptitude. The MCQ part was solvable. The coding questions were of moderate difficulty.
Round 2:
In this round, a coding question was given and I was told to solve it within a stipulated time. It was moderately difficult. A system design question was also asked for a cab booking platform.
Round 3:
I was asked to explain my projects in this round. Basic SQL commands were also tested. This was partly an HR round.
Tips:
A candidate must give primary focus to solving coding problems. Leetcode is a recommended platform. The questions which appeared on the interview rounds were mostly of Leetcode medium level.
Make sure to know everything written on the resume.
Try to grasp object-oriented concepts as some candidates were tested on these.
Try to ask a question about the company in the end.
Resources:
In my opinion, solving more problems will boost the chance of clearing the interview. Leetcode and
Hackerrank are excellent resources for the same. Some theory questions may also be asked from
course theory. The required concepts can be referred to from GFG.

Round 1 (Online assessment)
The test was conducted online on hackerrank
The test consisted of 2 coding questions and 12 MCQs. Each question had equal weightage.
The coding questions were graph related. One of them was a simple question to find the number of connections each node has in an undirected graph. The other one was on finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. I’m attaching the link to a similar question on leetcode
https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/
The MCQs were mostly based on DSA, OOPs and OS .OOPs questions were in java.There were some aptitude questions on probability and combinatorics.
The total time given for the test was 60 minutes which made it a bit difficult.
18 candidates got shortlisted for the interview rounds.
Round 2 (Interview Round)
I was asked to give a self intro by the interviewer.
He then proceeded to look into my resume and asked me to briefly explain my project.He asked me about my favorite subjects and the reason why I'm interested in them.
I was asked the reason I preferred to use the tech stack I used in my projects over the other options.
He asked me to find the minimum number of rotations on a sorted array needed to create the array given.I gave the brute force approach and then optimized the algorithm using binary search.I'm attaching the link to the question on leetcode
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/
I was asked to write the pseudocode on paper and to find the time complexity of my algorithm.Then I was asked some questions on time complexity.
I asked the interviewer about his experience with the firm when he asked if I had any questions.
The interview ended with some behavioral questions.
Round 3 (Interview Round)
The interviewer went through my resume and asked questions based on the skills mentioned.
I had given React.js as a skill so I was asked about the difference between a functional component and class component.I was not able to answer this correctly.
I was then asked some questions on javascript and MongoDB which I was able to answer.
The interviewer then moved on to coding questions where I was asked the Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks problem in leetcode. I was asked all 3 variations of the problem and was asked to write down the pseudocode for two of them on paper. I was able to answer the questions.
I was also asked to construct the DP table for the Best Time To Buy and Sell Stocks 3 problem .
The final question was to find the cycle length in an array where the array element value indicates the index to which the element is connected.I was able to solve the problem using a hash table but then I was asked to solve the problem using O(1) space which I was not able to.
TIPS
Do not worry if you have not done many projects as they focus mainly on your understanding of data structures and Algorithms and the things you have already learned.
Do not add projects or skills that you are not confident about as It would have a negative effect if you are not able to answer questions based on them.
Read about the company and the role.Find a good question to ask the interviewer.
Keep your cool and try to be relaxed before the interview.Interviewers are there to help you so don't hesitate to ask for help if you feel stuck.
Do lots of leetcode as most of the coding questions asked were directly from leetcode.
Prepare a good self intro and go through some behavioral questions that can be asked by the interviewer.
Do go through some puzzles on geeksforgeeks before the interview as they asked puzzles to some of the candidates.

Round 1:
The first round was an online test with two sections. The first section had about 10 MCQs
and two coding questions. The MCQs had questions from OOPs, DSA, networking,
probability, permutations etc. The coding questions were from graphs.
The second section had two subjective questions. One was what you would do if your
teammate had a sudden emergency and the project was due the next day.
Round 2:
The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. After that he asked me a few questions
based on my resume. He then gave me a few scenarios and asked what data structures I
would use. He and I talked about the advantages and problems of using the data structures I
mentioned. He then asked a puzzle on probability.
(https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/Probpuz/probpuz3.html) I unnecessarily complicated the
question and could not answer it, but he listened to my approach. Later on, I was asked to
explain something that I thought was complicated in two minutes. I talked about linear
regression. Before going we talked about college and the electives I had chosen for the next
semester.
Round 3:
The interviewer gave one coding question. That was the only question I got in this round.
Two numbers are given as input, you have to divide them and if the answer has a recurring
decimal you have to put that part in parentheses. If the input is 1 and 7 the answer will be
0.(142857). We discussed the algorithm, then he asked me to optimize it. I was then asked
to write the code in any language I was comfortable with. He was very patient and helped
me throughout the process.
Round 4:
The interviewer introduced herself and asked some questions based on my resume. I was
given almost three coding questions in this round. I did not have to write the code only the
algorithm. I tend to remain quiet when I get a question till, I figure out the answer, but my
interviewer wanted to know what I was thinking the whole time. One question was if you
are given a continuous stream of bits, after each bit you need to return true if the current
number is divisible by 5. For example, if the first bit is 1 return false, if the next bit is 0 (10 is
not divisible by 5) return false and if the next bit is 1 (101) return true and so on. In the end
she asked if I had any questions.

Round 1
This round comprised 12 multiple choice questions(I think) and 2 coding questions and a HR
question. Multiple choice questions were from topics like OS, DBMS, OOPS, coding etc. and coding
questions were related on graph topics like minimum spanning tree and shortest path algo. And a
behavioural question was asked regarding what you would do if your teammate has got into a
serious problem and there is a deadline nearby.
In this round, approx. 20 people were selected for next round.
Round 2
In this round, he asked a standard Leetcode medium question. I have written the code on paper and
explained line by line to the interviewer. Only one question and this round lasted for about 15
minutes.
I think 10 members were selected for next round.
Question:-
https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/
Round 3
In this round, she asked some questions about ReactJS, then she asked me to select a topic and I
chose binary trees. So, she asked a standard leetcode medium question. I have written code and
explained her line by line. She was pretty satisfied with my explanation. Then, she asked a
miscellaneous question which I came across for first time. I was completely blank on how to solve
that problem but my senior told me to not panic when they give a completely new question and told
me to explain all the methods possible and told me to express all my thoughts to tackle the problem.
So, I told her every possible solution to tackle the problem and she helped me throughout and I was
able to solve the problem at the end. And she was quite satisfied with my approach to a completely
new problem. Actually, the problem is not too hard but it seems not too hard when we know the
solution but I saw such type of question for first time and I panicked but I controlled my emotions
and was able to get the solution.

Round 4
I was asked a standard DSA question and I was able to solve it. Then, he asked many miscellaneous
questions related to system debugging, related to usage of DSA in real life and many more technical
questions. This lasted for about 40 minutes.
Question:

TIPS:
Solve at least 200 dsa standard questions and try to remember the intuition and approach behind
solving each problem not the solution for each problems. Explain every step you are going to do and
explain every step when writing solution on paper even though they are not listening to you. If you
are stuck on a problem explain every possible approach and they might help you. Be confident when
explaining your solutions.

Round 1 :
Online test was conducted on HackerRank.
There were 20 MCQs (with negative marking) and 2 coding questions.
MCQs were based on some aptitude and some technical questions (oops,SQL, etc.)
First Coding question was to find if a given number of players can be classified two teams, given the information of enemies and no two enemies can be in the same team.
Second Question involved strings. Given a string and a value k, we needed to reverse the first k characters for every 2*k length substring. Eg: string= ”abcdefgh”, k=2 output: “bacdfegh”.
Around 15 students were shortlisted for the 2 nd  round of interviews.
Round 2 :
It was an offline Technical Round.
I was asked to code the question similar to:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-prime-factors-of-a-given-number/
I got a couple of hints from the interviewer to finally give the efficient approach.
Then, he asked me to print the right view of a binary tree, after giving the BFS solution he asked if I could think of a recursive solution, I gave a brief idea and then time was up.
Around 7 were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3:
It was another Technical Round conducted offline. The interviewer was an alumnus of NITC.
It started off with my intro and some basic questions based on my projects.
Then, he asked me some questions on OOPS like what is an abstract class, difference between structures and classes, some real life use cases of classes etc. Then, he asked me a question on SQL as it was mentioned in my resume, it involved a specific function which I wasn’t able to recall so I just gave the idea of how the query would look and he moved on.
Then he asked me two coding questions: First one was to sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s in O(n) time and O(1) space, this I explained with the help of a two pointer approach and was asked the pseudo code.
Second question was the house-robber question, I wrote the pseudo code for this and then was asked to space optimise it, for the space optimization I told the approach and he was satisfied with it.
3 were selected for the next round.
Round 4:
It was another offline technical round(around 45 min). The interviewer was another alumnus of NITC.
It started off with my intro again and questions about what are my interests.
He gave me a data modelling question(because I had mentioned data science as one of my interests): Generating a random shuffle from a deck of 52 cards.
This round was more conversational wherein I asked him doubts, presented my ideas, he gave hints etc. It was to check how we think and the not our coding skill exactly.
All 3 moved to the HR round.
Round 5:
This was the HR round.
She asked basic questions like introduce yourself, about my family, about my plans after B.tech, etc.
She asked me about my previous interviews, why I chose Arcesium etc.
She mentioned that we would not be able to choose a preferred job location and if that was fine by me.
Finally, 2 were selected for the internship.
Tips :
It’s important to keep calm and interact with the interviewer as much as possible, most of them do give you hints and point you in the right direction.
Even if you are not getting a proper solution, make sure you explain your thought process and where you are getting stuck. Many times it’s just the thought process that they are interested in.
Important topics in my opinion include: Dp, trees, sorting etc. Difficulty of most of the problems were Leetcode medium type.
Do make sure that you are able to explain everything that’s mentioned on your resume.
Going through the company’s website can be helpful especially for the HR round.

Round 1:
Online test was conducted on HackerRank.
There were around 15 MCQs (with negative marking) and 2 coding questions.
MCQs were based on some aptitude and some technical questions (oops, SQL, etc.)
First Coding question was a very basic question in which we have to find the minimum number of toys we could buy. The cost array and total budget are given.
Second Question was a bit challenging. We had a 2D matrix with only 1s(Chapati) and 0s(Rice). We can flip any row or any column any number of times in any order. We
need to flip in such a way that we maximize the count of 1s.
In my case, 1
st
code was successful but 2
nd
code was partially successful (7/9 test cases were passed).
Around 17 students were shortlisted for the 2
nd
round of interviews. I was one of them.
Round 2
It was a Technical Round conducted on HackerRank Codepair (around 45 min).
I
was asked to code a question similar to
Rearrange a linked list such that all even and odd positioned nodes are together
I have successfully done the coding part and the interviewer was satisfied with the solution.
Then, she asked me another question similar to the
minimum no. of characters to be added at the front to make string a palindrome
.
She asked me to tell her the basic approach to solving this. I gave her 2 solutions. One was the brute force method and the other was an optimal method.
Around 8 were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3:
It was a Technical Round conducted offline (around 1 hour)
There were 2 Interviewers, they were very friendly so I didn’t feel tensed. I had a copy of my resume with me, they have gone through it for a while. Meanwhile, they asked me to introduce myself and asked me about any projects that I have done. As I have no projects, they started asking questions.
Initially, they asked me some questions on OOPS, some were right and some were not. Then, they asked me whether I am aware of DBMS, OS, etc. As I have no knowledge about those, I have said No.
Then they gave me a coding question similar to
rotten oranges.
They changed the question to factory instead of oranges and told me to write a pseudo code for this.
I took some time and explained my approach. Finally, he told me to code my approach on a piece of paper.
Then they asked some commands for Linux and other technical and some non-technical questions.
Around 4 were selected for the next round.
Round 4:
It was a Technical Round conducted on HackerRank Codepair (around 45 min). The interviewer is an alumnus of NITC.
He asked me to introduce myself then he gave me a math puzzle to solve.
I have solved that puzzle by taking a hint. He was friendly and helped me to solve the puzzle.
Then he gave me a coding question. I have never seen or practiced such type of a question before. I tried and explained my approach, then he asked me to code it. I was successful in coding it. The question was based on stacks.
Then he asked me some Technical and Non-Technical questions.
3 were shortlisted for HR Round.
Round 5:
HR Round was offline (around 15 min)
He asked very basic questions like introduce yourself, about our family, about my plans after Btech, etc.
He asked me “Why didn’t you get into previous companies that came?”, “Why Arcesium?”, etc.
He also asked me how many people were using Facebook at that exact time we were speaking. He was not expecting the correct answer, but he wanted to see what are all the aspects we are observing and up to what extent our thinking ability is.
Finally, 3 were selected for the internship.
Tips:
Try to interact more with the interviewer, whatever approach you know, tell them confidently. They will also help you by giving a failed test case and they will also help by giving some hints.
Actually, I don’t have any projects. I recommend you to have one because explaining the projects kills some time in the interview. They also expect you to have atleast one project.
Be precise when you prepare your resume. They will definitely go through your resume and ask about a few key points.
Try to solve questions from different platforms. Prefer solving medium level questions.
Before attending the interview, just check about the company, what it does, etc. This might be helpful in answering questions in the HR round.

Number of rounds: 5
(1 online test + 3 technical + 1 HR)
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 4
Round 1:
Online test on HackerRank
Consisted of Two Coding Questions and MCQs (around 15 questions with negative marking)
Coding Questions:
The first question was pretty basic, we had to find the maximum number of toys we could buy given a cost array and a total budget.
The Second Question was challenging, we had a 2D matrix with only 1s and zeros we could flip any row or any column. We can flip an infinite number of times in any order. Flip optimally to maximize 1s and return the count of the maximized 1s. (0 was called Rice and 1 was called chapati). My code passed 8/9 Test Cases.
MCQs covered the topics from Aptitude and some technical questions.
17 students were shortlisted for the interviews.
Round 2:
Technical Round on HackerRank Codepair ( 45 min )
He asked me if I knew about exponentiation, but I didn’t so he moved on to the next question.
I was asked to code a binary search question similar to the First and last position of an element in a sorted array
I was able to complete the entire code and explain my approach, he was satisfied with my explanation and approach to the question.
Next, he asked how I would find the end of an array if the size was not given in optimal time.
We were short on time because the interview started a bit late due to some technical issues so he had to end it fast.
Around 8 were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3:
Technical Round on HackerRank Codepair ( 45 min )
Given a binary tree, I was asked to code a function that updates each node to the value of the node itself plus its left subtree.
I explained my approach (which was a brute force approach), and she asked me to optimize my approach. I optimized the approach. She was satisfied.
Then she asked me to code it from scratch and run it on a few test cases given.
4 were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 4:
Technical Round offline
Two interviewers sat in the room one interviewing me the other just kept to his laptop keenly observing me and possibly verifying what I was saying.
Asked me to introduce myself, then went on to my resume and asked me to explain the projects that I had mentioned.
He asked deep questions about React and NextJS and other things that I had put on my resume, some of which I could answer, some of which I could not.
He asked me about my experience with positions and responsibilities that I had mentioned on my resume what I did recently and details about it.
Then a puzzle: The 100 prisoners with 100 boxes Puzzle.
Then he asked about a problem similar to the Max Area of Islands and told me to explain my approach on paper. After I was able to come up with a solution, he modified it a bit and gave me a ‘bridge’ (a '1' that I could put anywhere to connect two islands) and asked me to find the optimal spot to put the one to maximize the maximum area.
He finally asked me to code my approach on a piece of paper and explain my code.
3 were shortlisted for HR Round
Round 5:
HR Round was offline 1 on 1 platform ( 15 min )
Simple Questions: introduce yourself, about your family, why didn’t you get into previous companies that came? Why Arcesium and not some MNCs like Oracle?
He also asked me how many people I thought were using Facebook at that exact time we were speaking. He didn’t want the right answer but wanted to see my thinking process.
Finally, 3 were selected for the internship.
Tips:
Try to convey your approach/idea to the interviewer confidently. The interviewer will help you by giving some hints.
Even if you explain a wrong approach, do it confidently. They will correct you and present you with a test case that is not passing your approach and you can build from there, do not sound unsure and leave them no space to correct you.
Do not act too friendly or be too nervous around the interviewer, be in that professional sweet spot.
Try to solve as many problems as you can from different platforms like Leetcode, GFG, etc. Do easy and hard problems but focus on medium ones more.
Being good at Dynamic Programming will help you a lot in round 4, most high-paying companies love to ask DP.
Only mention the projects that you can explain in the resume. Read up on the theory behind the frameworks you used if you don't know them already before the interview.
Write the answers to common questions like Introduction, Weaknesses, and Why that company down before interviews, have a concise answer ready so you can say it without stuttering.

Round 1 (Online test):
The online test had 2 online questions and around 10 MCQs. The first coding question was about passing a ball in a circle and finding where it ended, The second question was about logical operations (XOR I think). I got partials in both these coding questions. The MCQs were mixed with basic OS questions, debugging, aptitude, and English grammar/speaking. I did not have too much hope after the online round.
Round 2 (Interview 1):
I was the first candidate for the interviewer. He started off with asking me to introduce myself and went on to go through my resume. He also opened my project and asked a few general questions about it. Later he went on to ask a DSA question. Starting with 1=A, 2=B so on and 27 = AA, 28 = AB so on, find the alphabet representation given a number. I misunderstood the question initially but then later went on to solve it with a stack. He then asked a bunch of general questions like where I see myself in 3 years, my plans for master’s, and my experience with projects and hackathons. I was pretty confident after this round.
Round 3(Interview 2):
The second round started off with a brief intro and he then went on to topics I knew. I was honest and said sorry to some of the topics he asked and then went on to ask a DSA question. The question was to find the largest possible chain from an array of strings where strings form a chain if the last character of a string
matches the first letter of another string. Ex; ring-guy-year-ring form a chain. I started writing the solution immediately but realized that it did not work for many test cases.
He moved on to a puzzle. There were three boxes with the following statements:
Box 1: I have gold,
Box 2: I have gold,
Box 3: Box 2 has gold. There are 2 lies and 1 truth in these statements and only one of the boxes actually had gold. Find out which box actually has gold. This was pretty simple and I answered it. The next question was to find the element that repeated more than n/2 times in an array of n integers. I had to sort it and check for the elements using 2 iterations of binary search. I took some time but I got the answer. He also asked me some basic questions on Inheritance and overriding when I told him that I was familiar with OOPS.
I wasn’t really confident after this round due to the DSA question.
Round 4(Interview 3):
The interviewer was really nice and did not want to test me on normal DSA and puzzles. He asked me to give a intro and I mentioned that I have been working on DSA. He asked me what all data structures I knew and he was interested in graphs. He asked me to implement a pre-requisite checker for a set of jobs using
graphs. I did not understand why I had to use graphs but he accepted my answer which was using an adjacency matrix. He then gave me a sheet of paper with C code and asked me to find the error. I
did not catch the error exactly but my idea was correct. When he gave me a couple of hints I found out the error, and I feel like he was impressed by this. The next question was on how I would use OOPS to implement a cricket info app. He was expecting a different answer but then moved on to the next
question. He later asked me about my experiences and I feel like he was studying my attitude.
Tips:
a. I personally felt that the interviewers paid a lot more attention to my attitude and
my honesty. They were really impressed whenever I expressed that I was ready
to learn new things even though I wasn’t aware of certain topics.
b. It’s always better to say NO rather than bluff and not answer questions based on
the topics. Also, it is really important to be thorough with all the skills mentioned
in your resume.
c. PS, it really helps to be strong with DSA and various topics like OS, OOPS, and
the basics of DBMS.
Resources:
a. Leetcode - I followed a series by Neetcode. It’s important to structure the questions you do and follow some sort of roadmap.
Others
I understand how overwhelming the preparation and interview process can be but it’s important to just hang on and keep trying your best. These interviews often require a combination of luck and preparation. Just keep trying and luck will definitely come by.

Round 1 (Online test):
The first round was an online test round wherein we were asked 2 coding questions and
around . The first coding question was about passing a ball in a circle and finding where it ended. For others the question was : Given two arrays,to check whether we can convert them in
such a way that the value at corresponding indexes of both the arrays are equal, if we are
allowed toswap values between the two arrays. The easy question was based on
strings.The second question was an easy question which included XOR operation. I got
both these coding questions.next section included several questions on aptitude, grammar ,maths and logical reasoning.
Around 40 students were shortlisted for the role.
Round 2 (Interview 1):
The second round was an online interview round. My second round lasted for maximum 20 mins. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and went on to my resume. Since my expertise was backend and web development, I had written extensively about it in my resume. And hence fortunately I was asked about it to. He asked what my favourtie programming language was and proceeded to question my knowledge on that. My respnse was python and he asked me questions on random module in python, and then he asked about dictionaries and asked about other data structures in python. Later he proceeded to ask about my projects. I had faired good in explaining what it was about, and was also able to answer any question thrown at me about the frameworks as well. He even asked about my positions held in the college.
About 13-14 of us got in Round 3
Round 3(Interview 2):
After that I was asked to wait for about 1, 1 and a half hours, and to be really honest I had given up on my interview, thinking that maybe I hadnt made it to the 3rd round. But yup, I waited and they gladly called me for Round 3. In this roung I was asked a programming question on arrays, and my nervousness got the best of me and I couldn’t answer it. But upon telling him that I was stuck, he helped me and we solved it together. Later again my Resume was searched thoroughly and he asked me about my DBMS knowledge and whats the difference between relational and non-relational databases, and about sqlite and about oracledbs and asked about my projects.
About 8-9 of us got in Round 4
Round 4(Interview 3):
Round 4 was HR round, to which I was asked behavioural question as well as about the current tech trends. I was asked how would I manage a rude boss, and how would I manage a tem mate who wasn’t cooperative. Later he asked me how I manage to stay up to date with the latest trends in Technology and would I be open to learn new softwares
Tips:
● Make sure to know your resume well. Do not and I repeat DO NOT write anything you don’t know
about in your resume
● You don’t have to strong in DSA, you have to know the basics well though.
● If your DSA isnt strong make sure to be well versed in any other domain, and do state it in your
resume so that your interview would be directed towards that domain.
● It is not necessary that your interviewer would expect you to know everything, so you can always
say that you don’t know or you need help.

Round 1:
The online test consisted of 2 coding questions and around 10 mcq
questions. One of the coding questions was of easy level and the other
was medium level. The medium question was : Given two arrays, we have
to check whether we can convert them in such a way that the value at
corresponding indexes of both the arrays are equal, if we are allowed to
swap values between the two arrays. The easy question was based on
strings. The MCQ questions were aptitude based consisting of distance-
time questions, maths, percentages, etc.
SHORTLISTED:
SERVER TECHNOLOGY: 31
APPS: 25
APPS WAITLIST: 8
Round 2:
Very chill interview spanning 20 to 30 minutes. I was asked to introduce
myself and he asked me a few follow-up questions. The interview was
centred on my resume and he went through each of my projects, asking
me to explain it. He did not get deep into the technical side of the projects
and just wanted to know how I developed it, and how I planned to improve
it. I was asked an easy coding question: “Given a string of lowercase
letters, find the vowels among them and reverse their order. Eg: hello
becomes holle”. I wrote the answer in python on paper and explained the
logic. He asked me to code it in VSCode on his laptop and run it. At the
end of the interview, he also asked me a few HR questions like how will I
deal with my work if it starts getting repetitive and I don't get new
challenges.
Round 3:
This round lasted around 25 minutes and also involved a thorough
discussion of my resume and the technologies I used in building those
projects. SInce I used APIs in my project, I was asked a few questions
about them. He asked me about the different types of APIs, what I knew
about each of them and the types of errors that can occur while using
REST APIs. He also asked me about HTML status codes. I was asked if I
knew JAVA since I did not list it in my resume, and he followed it up with a
few questions on exceptions and threads in JAVA. He asked me an easy
DSA question, to implement a stack using any other data structure. I
implemented it using 2 queues and I had to explain my logic and show how
it works on a few given test cases. We had a long conversation about
working at Oracle, what they do and the skills required at the company. At
the end, I asked him about Oracle Middleware and we talked about it
solely for 5 minutes.
Round 4:
This was completely an HR round. The interviewer was very chill and the
entire round was more like a conversation. He went through my resume,
asking me about the teams and committees I had been in. He asked me
some situation based HR questions and we discussed a lot on a
hierarchical model within a team. I was asked to give an example of a
technology I would build which would be used in my daily life and also
another one that could be used in any of my non-technical interests. He
asked a few usual HR questions like “ Why Oracle?”, “What do you expect
from the job?”,etc. This round also lasted around 30 minutes.
Tips:
● Research a lot on the company: what they do,what their products are and
prepare a good non- cliche question to ask the interviewer
● Keep conversing with the interviewer. During the interviews, you will enter
a large span of topics which you might not be expected to know in depth
like cloud computing, Cloud services, etc, but having a general idea on it
helps.
● Know your resume inside out. In addition to knowing the technical aspects,
be confident in explaining your project to the interviewer.
● For the assessment tests, practise a few general aptitude questions like
distance-time, simple and compound interests, work done, discounts,etc. A
little practice and you can easily crack all of them.
● Practice interview coding questions on geeksforgeeks (Yes, they do
repeat).

Round 1:
It was a casual round, the questions being mostly focused on my
resume. I was asked to write the code to perform an email validation in
javascript. It was followed by some relatively easier questions about
machine learning as there was mention of it in my resume. Questions
such as what algorithm would be best in clustering the data into four
groups, what activation function is applied on the output layer of
classification deep learning networks, about partitioning data into train,
test and validation splits. Nothing much was asked from DBMS as I had
informed beforehand that I was not quite familiar with it. Very few
questions were from the DSA side. I was asked about different tree data
structures. To conclude I was asked to write the code to print the pattern
of an inverted cone.
Round 2:
I was asked to code the solution to classic problems such as finding a
loop in a linked list, random number generator and two sum. Some
questions from OOPS followed. The diamond problem, definition of
virtual method, abstract class being some of those.I wasn’t able to
answer all of those. From there on it was solely behavioural questions
along the lines of what my biggest challenge as a programmer was, how
I would manage a teammate who is not contributing etc.
Round 3:
He inquired in detail about my projects. Subsequently there were a lot of
HR questions. How I would handle situations such as a team member
dropping out of the team, a deadline that has been pushed forward,
managing a position that requires an authoritarian attitude. Other
questions included what my biggest achievement was, what I would
have done had I not got that, my biggest breakthrough movement, my
strengths and flaws, innovative ideas I have come up with etc.
Tips:
Avoid exaggerating your skills in resume.
Be frank in admitting answers to questions you do not know
Prepare beforehand on what you would say if asked to describe
yourself, your biggest ordeal, how you overcame it etc..
Skim through the mostly asked interview questions. They do ask the
exact same questions from before and it is expected of you to answer
that.

Number of HR Rounds =

Round 1:
• We were asked 2 coding questions, along with questions on logical reasoning,
and English proficiency.
• I was able to solve one out of the 2 coding questions (both of which were
array problems of upper medium level).
• There was no negative marking, and the rest of the questions were solvable
with 12th grade mathematics and aptitude.
Round 2:
• The interviewer was really friendly and started off with asking me to introduce
myself, which I did and I casually steered the conversation to my projects, as I
was much more confident in it than DSA.
• He asked me to elaborate a bit on the projects that I did (both of which were
AI focused)
• He then moved on to ask me a simple sliding window question which was to
find the length of the longest substring with at most 2 distinct letters, and
asked to me write down the pseudocode for it as well.
• After I solved that, he asked me a variation of the Einstein houses riddle which
I was only able to solve partially, so he let it slide.
• I was also asked about BSTs and how insert and deletion is done, given an
array of numbers to insert, and asked me to write down the pseudo code for
inorder traversal.
• He then talked to me a bit more about cloud computing and the hosting
methods which I used to host my projects.
Round 3:
• The second interview went in a similar way to the first, but was a bit more DSA
focused.
• It started of with me introducing myself, and him asking a small puzzle.
• Then he asked me how I’d implement an autocomplete feature, i.e., an
algorithm that can suggest a few words given the first few letters. I suggested
a Trie based approach and it seemed to be what he wanted. I was also asked
to write down the pseudocode.
• The next question was an array generation problem. The problem went as
such:-
1. You’re given 2 arrays with repeating elements.
2. Let’s assume a number repeats x times in array 1, and y times in array 2
3. You are to create a third array in which this number repeats max(x, y)
times.
4. If the number is present in only one of the arrays, it should repeat the
same amount of times.
• I took a few seconds to think about the question, and to clarify I asked him
about the time & space complexity he expected and he said there is no
limitation and I can suggest what I feel is right.
• At first, I suggested a hash map to store each count of the letters and he didn’t
seem pleased with it, so I thought a bit more and suggested a binary search
with two pointer approach. At first he thought I did it wrong, but as I explained
it again, he accepted my solution.
• The interview ended with him asking if I had any questions, to which I asked
what tech stack that would be used and what the common roles of interns will
be, to which he replied that Application interns would be more involved with
CRM than their Server Tech counterparts, and that we would be using Java for
almost all our services.
Round 4:
• This round too was a technical round in which I was asked questions from
literally every topic.
• It started off with my introduction again, and the interviewer seemed to be
interested in my projects, much more than the previous rounds. He asked me
a lot of questions, about what I used to create the projects, when I started
learning about AI, and a lot of other things.
• He then told me a bit about Oracle’s upcoming roles in AI as well.
• He then proceeded to the question, the first one was to debug a C code, which
I suggested a solution, but it turned out not to be completely correct, but he
accepted it.
• He then asked me what I know about SQL, and I told him about the use of it
inside my projects and my current knowledge level. He asked me a simple
question on joining 2 tables, and I wrote down the answer, he then proceeded
to ask a bit more about SQL which even he didn’t expect me to answer.
• Then he asked me a simple DSA question which was to delete the repeating
elements from a sorted linked list, which I suggested a two pointer approach
and he accepted
• He then asked a OOPS question which was to implement a cricket score
tracking application, which when score gets updated, updates not just the
overall match score, but also the players individual scores as well. I suggested
a solution which he said was not the most optimal and scalable but was good
enough.
• This interview also ended with him asking for any questions, to which I asked
more about the AI partnership he mentioned, and if an intern would be given
any AI related projects, to which he assured me there are chances, but it
depends on a lot of other factors as well.
Round 5:
• This round lasted just 5 minutes, with the HR, who asked me about how the interview was, and any
complaints that I had (except for the fact that the whole process lasted 12 whole hours), which I
replied well apart from that, I had no complaints and most of the doubts that I had were
answered by the previous interviewers
.
• Out of us 25 interviewed for applications, 5 were finally selected.
Tips:
a. Practice a lot of leetcode medium problems, preferably follow a question sheet like
neetcode ( I’ve linked below )
b. Most of the puzzles and logical questions that were asked came directly, or were slight
modifications, from the gfg, so do refer them.
c. Don’t boast on your resume, as most of the interviews were based on our skills, and
don’t mix up knowing SQL from school with DBMS, as oracle is a SaaS company and they
will drill you with DBMS questions if you say you know it.
d. Either have a good array of projects which you can talk a lot about and answer their
doubts and questions, or be really thorough with DSA, as from the experience of those
with me, those without a lot of projects were asked much harder DSA problems than
those with projects.

Round 1:
The first round was an online test round wherein we were asked for four sections. The first section of the test included basic English questions like subject-verb agreement, reading comprehension, and vocabulary-based questions.
The second section of the test included basic mathematical aptitude questions like distance, averages, and probability-based questions.
The third section was based on OOPS and basic database management systems.
The four sections had MCQs based on BSTs, AVL Trees, and arrays. We had a negative 0.25 for every wrong answer. Overall, the test covered basic English, mathematics, and programming concepts. Revising DSA, the basics of DBMS, and OOPS will help a lot. Around 40 students were shortlisted for the role.
Round 2:
The second round was an online interview round. My second round lasted for 35 mins. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and went on to my resume. He asked me about a project on JavaScript and resources management using OOPs. He asked me to explain the overview of my projects and why I chose the same. He also asked me why I didn't host my website. To conclude my second round, the interviewer asked me a basic time and distance puzzle to which I explained my approach first and then gave the answer. Overall, the second round was mostly around my resume so be sure of what you mention.
Round 3:
After the second round, I had to wait around 15 mins for round 3 which lasted for around 45 mins. The second interviewer again started with the project and asked me how I implemented certain functions. He went on to question me on the basic data structures and gave me an array of questions to solve. He didn't expect me to code it but I had to open Notepad and explain my logic. I started with the brute force approach and then went on to optimize the same. He was satisfied with the answer and asked me other coding questions. I explained the logic and coded the function on Notepad. He didn't ask me to optimize my solution. He asked me if I had any questions for me to which I asked basic prepared questions like what do you expect from an intern in your team etc. After round 3, I was told I’m done for the day and they will let me know the results through TnP. A few people had 4 rounds of interviews but I didn't have a HR round.
Finally, 9 of us were selected for the role of Server Technology engineer, and by gods grace, I was one of them.
TIPS:
●
Prepare answers for questions like tell me about yourself, where does your interest lie in the field of CS
●
Do a lot of leetcode and puzzles. It's never too late to start.
●
You can tell the interviewer if you’re stuck or have no idea about what he is asking. They usually help you and it's
absolutely ok to ask for some time to come up with a logic for coding questions.
●
Gfg and interview bits help. Read through them for basic OS, DBMS, and OOPs concepts. Also, be thorough with S4
subjects and your project.
●
Have an open mind and interact positively with the interviewer.

ROUND 1
:
It was a proctored online test that was held on their own platform. We have to solve around 80 questions in 100-110 minutes.
Questions were divided into different sections and each had their own time limit. It comprised of Logical reasoning, Contextual communication, and General aptitude and OOPS, DBMS, OS, and DSA. OOPS questions were in JAVA. So, it’s better to have a basic idea of Java.
No negative marking.
ROUND 2
:
This was the first interview round. Due to some network issues, there’s a delay from my side. The interviewer was so friendly. He stayed all the time and he gave me some time to settle things up and asked me to cool down.
It started with an introduction about himself and then the question “Tell me about yourself.” and then a dive into Resume.
Since I mentioned some projects, there was a detailed discussion on them.
He then asked what I know about the company.
He then asked me about the Hourglass puzzle (
Puzzle 27 | (Hourglasses Puzzle) - GeeksforGeeks
). As far as I can remember, I was asked another puzzle too.
He asked some basic questions on OOPS.
After that, Interviewer asked me to open a text editor. He then gave the basic LeetCode questions – Two sum, 3 sum. He then asked me about a problem on BSTs.
I just need to show my code and explain it and there isn’t any need of running it.
At last, He asked me if I was having any questions for him. I asked him about his role and work environment.
ROUND 3
:
This round was mostly on OOPS. It started with the conceptual questions. He then asked me to open a text editor and asked me to implement some questions related to that. This discussion lasted for 15-20 mins.
He then asked me the “Find the fastest 3 horses” puzzle (
Puzzle 9 | (Find the fastest 3 horses) - GeeksforGeeks
). I was correct up to a point, but the interviewer pushed me to solve the question. He helped me to answer it.
He then asked me a typical popular LeetCode question (I don’t remember that). It was a sorting problem. As I practiced mostly from LeetCode during preparation, it helped me during these interviews.
ROUND 4
:
This round started with a series of HR questions. It’s better to prepare beforehand so that you don’t fumble with your words.
He then asked me if I know any who is currently working in Oracle and what he/she said about their work experience in Oracle.
The interviewer was really friendly. He noticed that I’m feeling tense. He asked me to turn off my cam and cool down.
And finally small problems – Factorial and Fibonacci series.
With this the interview ended. This round was around 15 mins.
TIPS
:
BLUFF.
BE CONFIDENT.
If you don’t know …accept it. The interviewer will help you.
Speak out what you have inside.
Practice on LEETCODE.
Be prepared with all the OOPS, DBMS concepts.
Make sure you are well-versed with all the DSA concepts.
Look up puzzles from Geeks for Geeks.
Practice HR questions. Be confident to face it.
Make sure you have an idea about the company like what does it do… Etc.

Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
This was the only online test that we had. The test was divided into 5 parts where they asked MCQs regarding aptitude, English skills (Comprehension, grammar, etc.), and various CS topics. There were a lot of questions focused on all kinds of trees including binary trees and AVL trees. They also asked many questions regarding various HTTP status codes where you had to choose an appropriate one for the scenario mentioned. Some of the questions were lengthy and the time was extremely limited, so I had to guess some of the questions at the end. They followed a similar format last year too. So, I would recommend focusing on these topics mentioned (in Geeks4Geeks or something) and not wasting time during the test.
Final Shortlist
1.
ST – 40
2.
APPS – 30
Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW
He started asking me questions regarding Computer Networks like what is a router, switch, and IP address and so many questions which I mostly have not answered or answered very vaguely about what I know about them since we learn about them in semester 6. I told him that these are not yet completed for us and that he just wanted to know what I know about them. In this part mostly he answered himself and I listened. Next, he asked a coding question
https://dev.to/kavitagupta972/hackerrank-coding-challenge-3p5j
I was not able to solve it completely but I explained brute force and a bit of improvement for that. Then he asked me to explain the project I wrote in my resume and asked a few basic questions (This helped me to kill some time). Most of the time he is very interactive and made me comfortable. Mainly I did not understand whether he is satisfied with my answer or not.
Round 3: SECOND INTERVIEW
I did not expect I would be qualified for the next round but I was. This round was good mostly I answered all questions. The interviewer started asking me so many basic C language questions.
Then he asked me a simple puzzle
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-3-calculate-total-distance-travelled-by-bee/
Then he asked me to write code to find the second last element in LinkedList.
Round 4: FINAL INTERVIEW
This round was almost totally HR for most of the people (5- 10 mins). But for me, it was about 30 mins.
He thoroughly went through my resume and touched each and every part of it (like skills, and projects). He spent so much time on my resume (Be careful with what you write)
Apparently, I felt he is not satisfied with my project (he felt they can easily be done).
He asked me a coding question
https://LeetCode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/
I haven’t done this in LeetCode before, so I took time to solve it and he helped me to optimize the brute force method. He finally asked me a coding question - Detect loop in LinkedList.
Tips
:
Keep coding throughout the vacation, one or two problems a day from hacker rank or LeetCode.
Ensure that you have a project mentioned on your resume (that helps to kill time, but also be thorough with what you have written)
Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it. Make it very interactive.
Do some research about the company and its motto before going to the interview.

The interview rounds were online.
Round 1:
Online test
The test was MCQ based. It had different sections and each section was timed. It had a range of questions from different topics like DSA, DBMS, Operating Systems, aptitude, general English, grammar, etc.
The most important part to be taken care of during this test is time management.
Round 2:
Technical round
The interviewer asked me to share my screen and open an online compiler. He asked me a few coding questions. The questions were mostly based on strings and arrays. The interviewer also asked a few theoretical questions. The last question he asked me in this round was to design an algorithm for a problem that he gave. He was really friendly. I remember him asking me to cool down seeing my anxiety!
Round 3:
Technical round
The interviewer asked me to code linked list operations. I had to write an entire program that involved insertion and deletion at different positions of the linked list, reversal, etc. A few questions on BST were also asked.
Round 4:
M
ix of Technical + HR round
A logical question was asked, and I was asked to code. He asked me about the projects which I had done earlier. He also asked me whether I had done any group projects before, to which my answer was no. He asked a few questions about my general interest in computers and the reason why I wish to join Oracle.
TIPS:
DSA is the key. Try practicing as many questions as possible.
Since the interview was online, we had to show our rough work through the camera.
Theoretical questions were mostly from OS, DBMS, and DSA. Don’t be overstressed.
Even if you are not able to get the exact solution, try sharing your thoughts and ideas with the interviewer. They may guide you and help you with their ideas.
Be confident. Believe in you and your efforts.
They may ask questions about the projects you mention in your resume. So it is important to have good knowledge about them before going for the interview.
Refer to GFG and other related sites for company-specific questions.
Interview diaries proved to be helpful during my preparation.

Round 1 (Test):
4 groups of Qs -
1 - English
2 - Aptitude
3 - Engineering Qs which include prob and math Qs
4 - CSE concepts like OS, OOPS, DBMS, AVL Trees
Round 2 (Interview 1):
Very chill interviewee, who started by asking about my current CGPA, then he went through my resume and asked questions from each section, and it felt like giving an elaborate introduction as I explained it.
He then asked a string question where it’s a string containing characters only in lowercase and can have duplicates. The output should print all the positions of unique characters (that have no repetitions) and print the first unique character in the string. He asked me to write the pseudocode on a notepad and share the screen.
Round 3(Interview 2):
She started by asking me to introduce myself and then wanted to know "Why Oracle?". She started by asking which language I am most proficient with, and then gave me a simple probability question - You have 3 friends in Calicut and I am in Delhi, the probability of one telling the truth is 2/3 and a lie is 1/3, so find the probability that it is actually raining in Calicut. Then she gave me a Hackerrank link which had a SQL question (because I had mentioned it on my resume) and one question on a string to remove "k" consecutive repetitive letters from the string, such that the final string returned has no "k" consecutive letters.
Round 4(Interview 3):
The third and final round started with explaining my project mentioned in the resume and I had to convince him how it worked and what would each part of the project do. Then there was one linked list question where I had to find the (n-7)th node by traversing only once. In the end, he asked a puzzle - There are 10 bags where each contains 'n' nodes, out of which 9 bags have coins weighing 1gm and one bag has coins weighing 0.9gms. We have a weighing scale on which we can put any combination of bags only or coins only or mix, but we can check the weight on the scale only once, not more. I have never seen this puzzle before but I got it, and it can be found in geeks4geeks. -

Tips:
Make a plan at the beginning of the vacation, and try to follow it as much as possible. I was trying my best to complete 5 Leetcode questions every day, including 1 Easy, 2 Medium, and 2 Hards (This one was really tiring to complete so would often end up doing only one hard a day). Choose a language early on and stick with it don’t keep shifting since you need good practice in one, plus doing a project in that language would also help. Next on the list would be doing theory subjects belonging to S5. Learn about operating systems, DBMS, Object-oriented programming, and computer networks (from Geeksforgeeks and Youtube) and revise S4 theory topics. Towards the end when time permits, topics which you feel you are weak in DSA can be practiced by taking Qs from the LoveBabbar excel sheet.

Test round (Round 1)-
The round was conducted on Hackerearth.
Q1.
You are given n robots with hi health and a 0 or 1 indicating moving left or right
respectively. These robots are arranged in a line in the order given in the input. If
two robots collide, the one with smaller health is destroyed while the health of the
other one is reduced by heath of destroyed one. In case of same amount of health,
both the robots are destroyed. Output the state of the remaining robots. (Stack)
Similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/asteroid-collision/
Q2.
Alice and Bob are standing in x1,y1 and x2,y2 respectively. N apples are going to fall
sequentially at xi,yi. Either Alice or Bob can fetch the apple. The cost of fetching an
apple is equal to the manhattan distance between the person and the apple.
What is the minimum cost of fetching all apple?
(Note- Apples have to fetched in order, i.e. The first apple needs to be fetched before
the second etc.) (2D DP)
Q3.
You have N+M candidates for an interview, each having cost fi for hiring as a frontend
dev and bi for hiring as backend. What is the minimum cost of hiring N frontend and
M backend devs? (Sorting+Greedy)
I was able to solve Q1 and Q3 fully with a partially correct solution in Q2. 9 people
were selected for round 2.
9 students were shortlisted.
Technical round I (Round 2)-
Implement a special queue with the following operations with the given time
complexities
Enqueue(num) - O(1)
Print() - O(n)
Clone() - O(1)
I was asked to write the pseudocode in Google docs. My initial logic was wrong,
which my interviewer pointed out. After some time, I was able to figure it out and
coded it, after which I was asked to implement one more function
Dequeue() - O(1)
3 people were selected for next round
Technical Round II (Round 3)-
Q1.
Given n jobs with start time, end time and job profit, choose jobs with maximum
profit such that there are no overlapping jobs
Same as
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/
I was asked to code the solution in any code editor of my choice. After coding, he
gave a few testcases and made sure that my solution was correct.
Q2.
You've been kidnapped and the kidnapper has loaded 2 bullets consecutively in his
revolver and spins the cylinder. He shoots you once, but the chamber was empty.
You now have two choices
• Let the kidnapper shoot you
• Let the kidnapper spin the cylinder and shoot you
What are the probabilities of survival in each case?
HR Round (Round 4)-
This round was somewhat informal. I was asked about my family and hobbies.
After which I was asked about a few generic HR questions like what to do to have a
proper work-life balance, what should be done if your team is lagging behind on a
project deadline and what my weaknesses are.

Coding Round
The coding test was held on HackerEarth. It consisted of three questions. I believe there was a question based on arrays (sliding window), a question based on topological sort (similar to
https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule- ii/description
/
), and a question based on trees (find the maximum number of edges you can remove such that sum of node values in each connected component is same). I did the arrays question and topological sort question.
Interview Round 1 (Technical)
Interviews were held on Google Meet. I was shared a Google doc where I had to write pseudocode for questions asked. The following two questions were asked:
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/
I was then asked to solve a given puzzle. However, I couldn’t do it.
Lastly, I was given a problem based on dynamic programming in a 2D grid. I was able to explain the basic idea to the interviewer. Due to time constraints, I was not asked to code it.
Interview Round
2
(Technical)
I do not recall much from this interview, but I was asked questions based on linked lists, binary trees (similar to
https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/
), and arrays. I was asked a question based on semaphores in operating systems. However, I had not studied this topic then and told the interviewer that I would be learning it in the upcoming semesters.
Interview Round
3
(Technical)
The interviewer asked me to tell him “My story”. He then asked me why the company was named Sprinklr. I had a vague idea of this, but I couldn't explain it to him, so he explained it to me. I was asked why I want to work at Sprinklr, what my favorite company was etc. I was also asked what I knew about cloud computing which I answered vaguely. I was just honest in this round. In retrospect, I might have been too honest and said some things other interviewers would have rejected me for. Nevertheless, he appreciated my honesty, and I got through :)
Tips
Practice a lot of DSA problems, especially on arrays and dynamic programming. Always try to start from a naïve or brute force approach and optimise your solution. Also, go through a few puzzles.

Round 1: ( Online
Test Round
)
This was an Online Test. It consisted of 3 questions each weighted differently. One question was on trees (which was hard). One was on graphs and another on arrays. I answered two of them which was enough to get me to the next round. If you are good with DSA I think you will find it easy.
Round 2 : ( Interview Round )
This was the first interview round I had. The interviewer was very kind and was ready to be helpful. He introduced himself and then asked me to introduce myself. In this round, I had to answer 3 DSA Questions. 1 on the array and the other two on DP. For the first one, I had to write the code in docs. Then I had to run the code in my environment with some input that he gave. Throughout the interview, I was asked to describe my thought process. Then he gave me the 2nd question for which I had the brute force algorithm and was kind of struck then he gave me a hint. Then I was able to answer that too. Then the 3rd was kind of tough but I was able to think through it quickly. Then he asked me about the complexity of my solution and asked me to reason about its correctness. I only had to implement solutions for the first 2. For the third one, he was convinced by my reasoning and said “No need to code it”.
In the interview when I was running my code in my local environment he saw I was using Vim. And at the time I didn’t know the concept of registers in Vim. He explained to me about global registers + and *.  And at the end of the interview asked if there was anything I would like to ask. I think I asked something but I don’t quite remember.
Round 3 : ( Interview Round )
It started the same way. With greetings and introduction. Then I was asked to implement Hash Tables in C. I did it quickly. Then he went to ask me about the project in my resume and wanted to walk me through it. It was a project on text compression using Huffman encoding. At first, I started explaining, and mid-way through I thought I could do better so I asked him if he could share a jam-board. He was happy to share it then I started to explain it on the jam board then went on and ran through a small example. Then He asked me what my interests were, at the time I was interested in learning Neural Networks. So I explained why I was interested in them. I was good in theory for Neural Networks because of MIT lectures and 3b1b videos. So I told him everything I knew and also told him what I wasn’t too sure of. Then He asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked him What will I be expected to work on if I got selected. Then he answered it.
Round 4: ( HR INTERVIEW ROUND )
This Round was not a technical round. First, she introduced herself and asked to tell me about myself which was not already on my resume. Then she asked me about my interests, Hobbies. I replied that I’m interested in watching anime, critiquing anime, listening to music etc. And then she went on to ask me about my weakness. To which I replied that talking to people was not my stronghold but I’m better at it now. Then she asked me why I think I’m getting better. Then she went on to ask me about how I wanted my career to look even if I was not with sprinklr. Then she asked me what I thought my strength was. I answered that I will never fool myself into thinking I understand something which I don’t. Then she asked me whether I prefer the backend or frontend development. Then she asked me if I had any questions. I asked some cliche questions which I don’t quite remember.
TIPS:
●
Prepare well. Practice problems on sites like leetcode, and geeksforgeeks. Attempt contests regularly this will help you be able to solve them in time.
●
Don’t get discouraged if you fail the interviews. You just have to try again in the next test.
●
Be Confident in the interviews. Have a deep breath if you think you are rushing. Pace yourself well in the interview.
●
Be honest if you don’t know stuff. They will change the topic for you.
●
Prepare for cliche questions.
●
If you have done enough DSA. Then write a good Project. And know your project inside out. It’s good to have 2-3 good projects.
●
I didn’t get any questions on OOPs in this interview but you should prepare concepts in OOPs as it is a major topic on which they ask questions.
