Internship selection for GS, 2016
Cgpa cutoff - 7.5/8 
Position - Technology analyst
CTC - 21 LPA
Coding round 
MCQ questions about some basics in CS like time complexity etc.
2 coding questions ( learn DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING - very important topic as almost all good companies will surely ask a question from DP) 
Interview 
The process had 2 technical rounds and 1 HR round.
Some interview qns asked were:
-  Write a function that returns a random value without using the Rand function or any predefined functions which gives random value. 
-  When you do a google search, you get a list of auto suggestions. Which data structure do you think is used for showing these auto suggestions and how would you implement them?
-  Tell some differences between stack and linked list.
-  Where did you hear about Goldman Sachs?
-  Tell me about yourself.
-  Are you a team player?
Make sure you are confident and keep a smile on your face. Learning dynamic programming from geeksforgeeks and coding in hackerrank helped me.
GS selected 8 students for the internship programme.
Based on the internship performance, GS gave 3 of the 8 interns a PPO.

CGPA cutoff: 6.5
CTC : 10.8 LPA
Screening Test
The screening test was a combination of MCQ’s and Coding Questions. The MCQ’s were mainly based on time complexities, stability of sorting algorithms, OOPs concepts, DBMS, OS etc.
Coding Question:
Find the sum of all elements of the subsets formed by contiguous elements from a given set. (Preference for codes with lesser complexity).
Input: {1,2,3}
Output: 20
Explanation: {1}+{2}+{3}+{1+2}+{2+3}+{1+2+3} = 20
Interview Round 1 (Technical Round):
Some Puzzle questions were asked. 
Example : We have 50 identical balls of same weight and one out of which is defective with slightly lesser weight. Find the defective one from it.  
A hierarchical tree of an educational institution was given, in which the Dean is the root node and under him are the HODs for different Departments and under each of the HODs are the faculties. I was asked to design Schema, Tables for representing the information in a database. The concerned primary keys, foreign keys etc should be marked.  Further, given a particular node in the tree, a psuedocode to find the cumulative salary of all the people below and including the given node was asked. Also, given a particular node all the employees that should be reporting to the concerned node employee was to be listed out. Eg. Given the HOD of Dept CSE, all the faculties of CSE were to be listed out.
Interview Round 2 (Technical Round):
The questions were mostly based on my resume. Projects done and the internship experiences. I was asked to write a pseudo code to find the second largest element from an array. Try to give optimal methods if possible. There were also questions from OOPs concepts, DBMS (like joins), Computer Networks,  MySQL queries etc.
Interview Round 3 (HR): 
I was asked to introduce myself and a lot of personal questions were asked. I was told to explain my viewpoint about technology and some questions regarding my internship. The way we handle challenges and the spontaneity was checked.

Selection based on coding result
3 rounds - 2 technical 1 HR
First round - discussing code ,sorting ND complexity, resume, puzzles 
Second round - asked the subject in which ur weak upon mentioning questions from that area, scheduling algorithms ,variable scope and ambiguity resolution 
Third round - leadership qualities, adjusting in new environment, discussion on interests, weakness strength
For coding rounds refer questions from geeksforgeeks specifically dynamic programming(some companies did ask same question). It would be better if you can code in python ,inbuilt functions for string handling makes it easier than c/c++, thus better time management.
Practice basic logic and aptitude problems from their site.
There was a comprehensive reading passage test and a mathematical test on their website focussing on large calculations which can be solved using help of calculator in your room based on interest, average etc, but the results were not declared and I still don't know the significance as selection for interview was purely based on coding marks.
Overall keep a positive attitude, even if you don't know, don't bluff and don't just directly say no answer instead give it an honest attempt without wasting their time.
In most cases if ur answer is wrong (like mine) they check you, approach on how you answer and decide.

DevOps Profile - Direct-I
Nobody was selected for this profile. But I cleared two rounds. So I’ll share the questions asked to me.
Written Test (DOT - Direct-I Online Test) (In Aryabhatta):
Multiple choice questions were asked from OS, Networks and Linux. Very easy to clear. They selected about 35 students.
Coding Test (In CCC):
A server was setup for this round. The question was based on Socket Programming. I don’t remember the complete question, but it was something like this.
Question:
There are three programs, a server, publishers and consumers. We were not required to write code for publisher, only server and consumer codes were required. For each publisher, server will keep the messages in a named queue. Then on request of the client, the server will serve the messages.
Message format:
For query from Publisher to Server:
PUSH <name_of_queue> <message>
For query from Consumers to Server:
PULL <name_of_queue> <max_no_of_messages_required>
Objective 1: Implement above functionality.
Objective 2: Implement functionality for new messages fetch only. It means that you need to implement a functionality in server so that it will serve only the newest messages to the consumers. It was required to maintain a counter of the messages already served to the consumers in the server.
Objective 3: Implement above all cases for multiple consumers and publishers.
It was not required to implement all functionality completely. I finished only first objective, but when they asked me about my approach for second and third objective, I was able to tell them a approach which satisfied them. They were testing my conceptual understanding of the Socket Programming and its interaction with Linux Kernel in the coding round itself by repeatedly asking me questions.
They selected five people for interviews.
Interviews:
First Round:
He asked me about my projects in details. I had to explain three of my projects.
Then he asked me what can I do to improve these projects. I told him about my todo list of features which I want to implement.
He asked me about Linux from Scratch. He asked me why I did this project and what I learned.
Then he asked me some questions based on my Admin Job at SSL. That was easy.
Then he asked me to explain in detail SMTP and IMAP protocols.
He asked me how to get the mac address of a system given its IP address.
Asked about DHCP.
Difference between mutex and semaphore
Difference between fork and exec
Difference between hard link and soft link (On a conceptual basis, not the definitions)
This round was more based on Networks than OS.
Second Round:
She asked me to draw the 7 layer model.
Difference between ISO/OSI and IP/TCP stack.
Explain the ISO/OSI model layer by layer with examples. (when I was reading this model, I skipped TCP layer for later. That was my biggest mistake)
She understood that I am not thorough with TCP layer. Then she asked me about three way handshake.
Asked me the implementation of SSL. Whether SSL is part of TCP or Application layer.
Some questions based on Cryptography.
Working of Presentation and Session layer.
The implementation and working of ARP and RARP.
Regular expression for IP address.
How does a TCP session close?
I was not very clear with my understanding of basic 7 layer model functionality. They were very impressed with my projects, but they somehow felt that I need to brush up and revise my concepts. This profile’s interview is very easy if you know the basics. They usually ask OS also, but based on my qualifying test score and my coding round analysis, they thought that I am good in Networks. So more questions were asked related to Networks.
In the end, they told us that they are not selecting anyone. :(

Directi Interview Process
First Round
A coding round which consisted of 3 questions. Three different types of problems
Logical question
Dynamic Programming
Graphs question on minimum spanning tree
7 students solved at least 1 question. Out of which they selected 5 students for next round.
I solved 2 questions so I’m in for next round. List of questions: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s8w2B2HJx0sTGg-yPldHMCXGxXE9_bYfNQb10oTkAkU/edit?usp=sharing
Second Round
This round usually consists of three sub rounds. Out of which you need to qualify two rounds. All three rounds are algorithmic rounds. You will be given a question on algorithmic, then you need to come up with a solution, you will be asked to code the solution.
From most the interview experiences I saw in geeksforgeeks.. 1st question will be a logical or ad hoc type question. 2nd question will be an dynamic programming question. 3rd question will be a different data structure type question.
1st sub round
Given a string of parentheses, you need to count the number of balanced sub strings in the given string. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36158950/substrings-with-balanced-parentheses gives the question.
Expected solution is O(n).
I gave the solution and coded. The interviewer tested with some test cases. All cases gave correct answer but interviewer got confused with last test case and said I got a wrong answer to it. As the time extended more than 1 hour, he said I didn’t pass the round. After disconnecting the call I went through the answer once again but the answer is correct so I messaged him once again, then he recognized he made a mistake and said I passed the round.
Suggestion is DON’T GIVE UP.
2nd sub round
Given two arrays of same length. First array is an integer array consisting of positive and negative integers. Second array is a boolean array consisting of 0’s and 1’s. One operation is allowed on the boolean array: 
“ You can take any two adjacent bits and toggle them as many times as you want ”. for eg., given 100101 you can take the first two bits 10 and toggle them to 01. you can also take 00 and toggle them to 11. There is no limit on the number of operations.
The final question is after toggling them completely, find the maximum sum of numbers from first array whose corresponding bit in second array is 1.
Expected solution is O(n).
The interviewer here was not very interactive, so he didn’t speak much. But I was continuously interacting with him with giving him a solution and asking him for a hint. I said that the solution is Dynamic Programming. So he said that is a bigger hint that he can give me. Then I finally proposed at around 35-40mins of time. He asked me to code, I did it. Then asked me to explain the solution, I gave him a sample test case and explained it. He said this is also another solution and then said Good Bye.
Suggestion here: INTERACT WITH THE INTERVIEWER AS MUCH AS YOU CAN, TALK OUT LOUD. :) 
I passed these two rounds, so there is no need for next round. Other question asked to my friend was a standard Dynamic Programming question which is maximum dot product between two array by inserting zeros in the second array. 
http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-dot-product-two-arrays-insertion-0s/
From 2nd round only one cleared at least two rounds.
Third Round
This is a technical round, I heard that interviewer is a director of one of the department in Directi from HR. 
Before the actual interview, he went through my whole resume. He went through my Pull Request. I was asked to speak about any project, apart from my academic projects. Some questions were asked on the design of project. It went up around 20 mins.
Then asked a algorithmic question. Given two sets, First set is of size 1 million, 2nd set is of size 100k. Asked to find out the union of two sets. The solution is to do hashing. Then asked which one will u hash first(answer is we have to hash 100k numbers first).
Next questions on C++ stl. what is map and unordered map. Which data structure is actually used to implement both of them. What is the difference between them. In which cases do you use map and which cases do you use unordered map. I was not able to answer most of the questions.
He asked whether he could ask questions on Networks. But I said Networks subject is not completed for us :P.
Then asked a question on CSS. Given the html snippet:
<ul>
  <li>..</li>
  <li>..</li>
  <li>..</li>
</ul>
You need to change the font of only the second li without changing html. You should use only css. I am not able to answer this question too.
Then he started questions on software engineering.
What are design patterns. Name some design patterns. I don’t know this too.
Then Given a code asked to identify the error in the code:
var abcdef = time.now().format(MMDDYYYY); 
The error was ‘abcdef’ is not the correct name. It should be formattedTime or formattedDate or name something that is meaningful or something that is user readable.
Then given another code asked to modify the code, in a different way.
mailOnlineUsers = function(){
var users = database.retrieve();
for user in users:
if(user.online()):
user.sendMail();
}
The solution to this instead of retrieving the users and then checking online, retrieve only the users who are online and then send mail directly without a need to check online. Here is the modified code.
mailOnlineUsers = function(){
var users = database.retrieveOnlyOnline();
for user in users:
user.sendMail();
}
I was not able to answer this too.
Finally the interview ended with any questions from my side. Interview lasted for around 45-50mins.
Suggestion Here: Don’t bluff, try to be yourself. Try for sometime, say Don’t remember if you can’t answer a question.
HR Round
This is the chillest round, where they test how you are able to communicate with others. He asked about my 2nd and 3rd round interview experience. Then he told the technical interviewer was director of some blah blah department. Then asked what are different direct products. Then asked how is my placements preparation. Then asked which platform do I like for competitive coding. Then He asked whether did I go through the profiles that they offer us. Then he burst the news that they offer me a Application Engineer profile. 
Suggestion Here: Go through the company profile, research about the company before attending any company.
Final Suggestion to Directi: Having a good knowledge about data structures and algorithms is enough to clear first two rounds. Third round depends on the interviewer. So for the first two rounds, practice all the previous directi interview questions.

AUTHOR : SAAHIL KAMAT
<saahilsuhas_b150470cs@nitc.ac.in> 
Cisco came to our college to hire interns in my 6th semester. This is a very good company for someone interested in networks. The selection was open to CSE and EEE.
The initial round was an online screening test and consisted of MCQs. Topics included logical reasoning, networks, OS, DBMS, OOPS concepts and some language specific questions related to Java, C++, Python. I think there were some questions on logic design as well. The test didn’t have any coding questions. I think there were 60 questions to be solved in 90 minutes and there were no negative marks so obviously you increase your chances if you attempt everything by managing your time well. Anyways the time was just about sufficient according to me.
Then come the interview rounds.
1st Round
1st round was primarily based on my resume. I was asked to describe my projects in depth. Make sure to have good projects in your resume (This is kinda needed for any company really) and that the projects involve different concepts/tools/languages etc. Before going to the interview, you must know what you have coded in the projects and why it is coded that specific way. Some interviewer can really grill you on these things. I was asked in-depth questions about XOS which I had listed on my resume. He also asked me if I knew anything about networks to which I said no and that was it about networks. It’s a plus point if you know about networks for Cisco interview though, after all, it’s a networking company.
2nd round
2nd round was a coding round. 2 questions were asked. Both were a cake-walk.
Merge two BST’s into a single BST. No space or time constraints, which makes this a very easy question.
You can just insert elements from one tree into the other and delete the node from the first tree.
Detect loop in a linked list.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/
Do check out previous questions asked in Cisco interviews here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cisco-interview-preparation/
3rd round
3rd round was HR + coding. The guy started by asking my plans for higher education? The correct answer to this was “no plans” obviously, which I answered. It’s a trick question. Do remember this answer for your interviews. Few more questions were asked about my interests etc. Be prepared for such kind of HR questions. Then he asked me a problem related to static variables in C++.
4th round
4th round was a chill round where me and the interviewer had a nice chat. I think he was trying to figure my personality or something. He asked me where I was from, my hobbies, future plans/life goals and why Cisco? This is a very important question in any interview btw. Do research about the company you are interviewing for. Also please have some hobbies other than studying, philately and numismatics.

NETWORK/SYSTEM ENGINEER 
AUTHOR : G ROSHAN KRISHNA 
<roshankrishna.official@gmail.com> 
Name: G Roshan Krishna
Company: Cisco
CGPA Cutoff: 7.00
Number of people selected: 7
CTC: 14.4L
The number of rounds was either 3 or 4 rounds for different applicants. I had 4 rounds. There was one interviewer for the 1st round, a pair for the 2nd round, one for the 3rd and an HR person for the 4th round. First 3 were technical and the 4th was HR. The 1st and 3rd round were moderately easy. The second round was like a pressure test. The HR round was very informal.
The preliminary test was online with MCQ questions. Questions will be based on both hardware and software programming. Both CSE and ECE students will be given opportunity to write. 
The 1st round focused on how to approach a problem and how we solve it. 
- explain any one of the projects listed in resume.
- the different modules and how they were connected, basically how the system worked
- draw a class diagram and sequence diagram for the system and explain the different actors in the software. 
- design a system that takes in documents of various file formats and then convert to a single format as required by the system.
- draw a diagram of all the different modules and explain each of them with proper arrows showing the flow of data in the system.
He asked about all the platforms and languages that I was familiar with. 
He also asked if I had any certifications from Cisco.
The 2nd round was like a pressure test. There were 2 interviewers. 
- the field in computer science that I was interested in, for which I answered Machine learning and AI
- the relevance of the field 
- convince them that this field was promising 
- describe how it would help the company 
- in which all products I would integrate ML in (This requires proper research about the company and their products.)
Then they asked me if I’ll leave the company for higher studies or in case I get a better opportunity than this, with the job profile focusing on AI. They wanted to be convinced that I was a worthy investment. 
They asked more questions about ML and security and asked me if AI will crack a secure system firewall. 
They also asked a few programming level questions that focused on OS knowledge and how a process is compiled and processed. Their objective was to make you uncomfortable and make you answer questions under stress.
The 3rd round was much more relaxed. One interviewer was conducting it. 
- questions related to the importance of security in network systems and how such systems can be compromised. 
- explain different attacks to systems and how to prevent them. 
She also asked me about my professional goals and what I expect from the company. 
She then explained about her role in the company.
The 4th round was a HR round. 
The HR person asked me about the native place, where I live, family background, and childhood education. It seemed more like an informal conversation than an interview. He asked me about the preference of location and explained about the work hours. He asked about my interests and hobbies and concluded by giving details about joining date and office locations.
Preparation
It depends on what profile you want to get from the company. There are three profiles - System, Network and Applications. 
Systems profile requires knowledge about networking and systems hardware. 
Network profile required knowledge about network protocols, various layers of a network, routing algorithms etc., basically all that was taught in the Computer Networks course.
Applications profile requires knowledge about data structures, algorithms, software development life cycle, class/sequence diagrams, data encryption techniques, computer security etc.
They do not tell you what kind of profile you are interviewing for. The first interview will decide what your interests and abilities are and from the second interview onwards, they will ask questions based on what they feel is a suitable profile for you. 
Preparation for the profile that you're interested in is a must. But if you're not particular about your profile, you can prepare for all three profiles. I prepared from online sources like  geeksforgeeks, wikipedia, stackoverflow, etc.
Keeping a cool head is important. If you don't know something, confess that you don't know instead of saying something wrong. You need to display a strong character and work ethic.

AUTHOR : YASH AGARWAL 
<yashagarwaljpr@gmail.com> 
The Process
After the initial test(which consisted of technical questions from both CS and ECE branches), 28 students were shortlisted for the interview round. 
There were three different profiles at Cisco, Application Engineer, Systems Engineer and Network Engineer(I don't exactly remember the positions). Depending on how one performs in the interviews, they decide which profile you are most suited for.
There were 3-4 rounds of interview depending on how well one does in the first 2 rounds.
There were 3 panels who conducted the interview rounds 1 and 2. Each of them had different kinds of questions. If you were interviewed by Panel-1, and if you make it to the second round, you will get one of the other two panels. All of them asked technical questions.
Once these rounds were done, some people were eliminated. Then, some people had HR interview, whereas others had the soft interview round.
The last round is a very soft HR round. They will ask you where you stay, where you would like to work etc. and take down some of your personal details.
Total number of selected candidates : 7
From CSE : 4
From ECE : 3
Network/System Engineer Profile:
First Round:
They asked me about my projects which I had in my resume. Most of my projects were hobby projects, so they were interested in knowing, why I thought of doing this particular project, what all approaches I tried, what difficulties did I face etc. I explained everything in detail. Then they asked me what I do in SSL as an admin. Based on my answer, they gave me some situations and asked me to find a solution for them.
Questions were:
1. Suppose a router has capacity to connect maximum 20 people. Now 100 people are trying to connect to the router. What will happen?
2. How can we solve the problem that appears in the router in the above scenario?
3. How can you turn on a machine using another remote machine?
4. Suppose there are two systems in two different subnets. Can you power on a system in one subnet using the system in another subnet?
5. What was the most difficult problem that you solved in SSL?
6. How do you convince your team members that your idea is the most suitable one? (context was how to decide which OS to install on a server, Ubuntu or Debian)
7. What do you do as a team leader when your team can’t reach on a majority vote for a problem solution?
The time for this round was about 20 minutes.
Second Round:
This round was more of an HR cum Technical round.
Questions were:
1. Why do you want to join Cisco?
2. What motivated you to do all the projects in your resume?
3. He asked me about my work on Linux from Scratch.
4. He asked me whether I have any questions for him? I asked him about firewall authentication. Luckily he said that this is his current work and his team is working on a product based on firewalls.
The time for this round was about 10 minutes.
Third Round:
He asked me about my location preference, where do I live, did I go to Kota for JEE coaching...
The time for this round was about 5 minutes.

TECHNICAL STAFF
AUTHOR : DIMPAL GURABANI
<dimpalgurabani93@gmail.com>
 Adobe’s recruitment drive was during August, offering the profile of Member of Technical Staff for female candidates with the consistent record of having at least 75% from 10th std. Most of the students were already placed by that time. Those who were placed for the package higher than 15 LPA were exempted from the first round (online exam). 
Round-1 
The first round was an online exam consisting of MCQ questions including from topics like aptitude, logical, general English questions and two coding questions. 
Quantitative Aptitude and Logical part questions were more intuitive. They were not very difficult but were tricky. General English questions were easy. Coding questions were also easy because half an hour was given for two questions. Solutions with brute force approach were sufficient to pass the given test cases. 
Tips: Practice questions from sites like Indiabix, leetcode and geeksforgeeks as it will give the confidence to solve problems. If no information is provided about negative marking in the online test, do not attempt the questions if you don't know the answers. Solve the questions with the calm mind. Don’t stress yourself during the test. Don’t spend too much time on any question if you are not able to do it in the first attempt. 
The six girls were selected from online exam out of around 100, and six had package higher than 15 LPA. So, 12 girls were called for an interview in Chennai. 
Round-2 (Technical Interview Round-1) 
Questions: 
1. The interviewer asked me two coding questions. The first one was to write pseudocode for reversal of linked list. I had to write all three approaches and discussed about the pros and cons of all. The second one was to write pseudo code to find the number of rotation in the sorted rotated array. For that also, I started with the naive approach, and he made me write the efficient approach. 
2. I was asked about my favourite project and then discussed that.
 The interview lasted about 30-40 mins. Almost all, 10 out of 12 cleared the second round. 
Tips: Write pseudo code neatly. Explain the project using more diagrams. 
Round-3 (Technical Interview Round-2) 
Questions: 
1. The interviewer asked me to write pseudocode to find whether the linked list is circular or not. 
2. I was asked to solve the triangle and ants puzzle. 
3. The interviewer asked to write code to find the mirror image of the tree with the discussion on pros and cons of iterative and recursive approach. 
4. The interviewer asked questions regarding hash functions: why the mod operation in modular hashing is performed with the maximum prime number but not the with the maximum size of the table? 
5. Basic OS concepts from scheduling: Which scheduler is used in windows, Linux and mac os and why? Which scheduler is the best? 
6. Discussion on the favourite project. 
7. I was given the opportunity to ask questions. I asked some questions about his experience in Adobe. 
Tips: Try to get some practical knowledge of subjects. Give your thoughts on every questions being asked even though you don't know the correct answer.
 Round-4 (Technical Interview Round-3) 
Questions: 
1. The interviewer asked to write the formula to find the maximum occurrence of a given pattern in the string. 
2. The interviewer gave one puzzle to solve which I mapped with Josephus puzzle and explained. 
3. Discussion on what happens when you type a URL in a browser. 
4. Discussion on the favourite project.
 Round-5 (HR Round) 
Questions: 
1. Tell me something that you are proud of yourself and not written in the resume. 
2. Asked some questions about Adobe: Meaning of Adobe? How company was initiated? CEO of Adobe? Founder of Adobe? 
3. Why are they recruiting female candidates only? 
4. Why I will join Adobe as I was already placed in DELL R&D.

TECHNICAL STAFF
AUTHOR : SIREESHA PASUMARTHY
 Hello guys, First of all, all the best for your placements. I know you guys are tensed about interviews, how to face them and all. Getting placed in a good company will definitely boost your career. I will share my views and experiences with you. I hope it helps you. 
For Adobe, this offer was only open to girls. 
We had a written test first, which had two parts. 
One for MCQs and other for coding. 
MCQs are from Data structures, Operating systems, DBMS, Logical reasoning. Coding part had two questions, one based on arrays and other based on knapsack problem. 
Around 13 people are selected for the next round.
 We had our interviews in Chennai. 
I had 3 technical rounds and 1 HR round. It took an entire day for the interviews. 
First technical round was more like checking whether our basics are correct in various subjects and whether we are able to solve problems. I was asked to write code in proper syntax completely , not just write the algorithm. There is no restriction on programming language. You can use any language which you are comfortable in. I was asked questions on mutex, semaphores in operating systems. These concepts are really important. They are a bit confusing, but be clear about them. I was asked to code for trees. Questions were not very hard but still you need logical thinking to solve them. I was interviewed for 45 min in first round.
 Second technical round was more in depth to the concepts and logical thinking. I was asked to explain about my projects (including my major project) and questions were asked about them. I was asked about the differences in a desktop OS and mobile OS. I was given coding questions on linked lists and graphs. And I was asked many logical reasoning questions and some puzzles. This round went on for 1 and 1/2 hour. To clear this round, you have to be very clear in your concepts and must possess logical thinking. 
Third technical round was completely on logical thinking. I was given a puzzle to solve. The way you are approaching the answer is taken into account than the final answer. Always speak your thinking process. It allows them to understand your thinking process. If you feel you are wrong, accept it. If you are stuck, they will definitely give hints. Its up to you how you use them. This round went for 40 minutes. 
Last round was HR. In this round, I was asked to interview HR for 15 minutes and later normal HR session went on. This round went on for 30 minutes. I know it's very hectic, you will be drained out by the end. But guys, it's worth it. 
Adobe is really a great place to work. People are pretty chill in the interview too. Apart from Adobe experience, I would say placements really tests your patience. Trust me, I had attended interviews for around 10 companies. Just don't loose hope and don't give up. 
Work hard. Be confident in your answers ,have a smile and trust yourself. Accept it when you are wrong. Never lie in interviews, even if it's about your hobbies. 
Sometimes they may ask questions about your hobbies. If you lie, you will get caught. It's not needed that you should know everything, it's sometimes okay to say "I don't know about it." 
And every interview has this one question , What is your favorite subject and why do you like it. 
Be ready with your answer and usually your interview starts from that subject. 
Guys, there are no restrictions on programming language anywhere in interviews or written tests. You guys will anyway know C, but it's better to know an object oriented language. At least know OOPS concepts clearly. 
Mostly questions will be from Data structures, Algorithms, Operating systems, DBMS, Networks, Web Programming (if you are not good at anything, tell it, they will skip to another subject). GeeksforGeeks provides amazing material on every subject. Usually, you will find answers there for all your placement questions. Know at least basic algorithms like sorting techniques, some dynamic programming algorithms, tree algorithms. Calculate complexities properly. Always write in resume what you know properly(even projects).In many companies one entire round will be about the project you did. If you write about web project, questions will be on how you handle data and concurrency. Write tests for all companies . It gives you experience. All the hard work you do for placements is really worth guys. 
Be prepared and enjoy your experiences. Learn from your mistakes in previous interviews and don't repeat them. I hope you got some idea about interviews. Good Luck !!!
WE COME TO THE LAST ISSUE OF INTERVIEW DIARIES TODAY. WE HOPE THE POSTS HELP IN PREPPING YOU UP FOR THE INTERVIEWS AHEAD. 
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST!!!

R&D DEVELOPER
AUTHOR: DOBSON
Aptitude Test
The first round was an aptitude test. It contained some computer science multiple choice questions, some logical analysis questions and few programming questions. The cut off was 7 CGPA. 
Interview
After the test, they selected some of us for interviews. According to my observations, they had already decided to take all people above 7.5 CGPA with decent knowledge in computer science. 
There were 3 rounds of interviews. Technical, managerial, and HR.
In technical and managerial rounds, they asked few common puzzles. I was familiar with them and it was easy for me to answer. 
After the first round itself, it seemed like they had decided whom to take, so the other two rounds were pretty chill. They just asked about my hobbies, family, fears and all such simple things.
CTC offered is 11.25 + 1.5 joining bonus.

SUMMER ANALYST (INTERN)
AUTHOR : ARCHANA NARAYANAN
< archana7950@gmail.com >
There was a preliminary online test that consisted of many aptitude questions and a few coding ones. The patterns are pretty similar with the previous years. Going through a few aptitude questions and brushing up a bit of competitive coding questions will certainly help you get shortlisted for the interview. Compared to the exams of companies like Amazon and Directi, JPMC test is considerably easy.
As for the reference, geeksforgeeks, hackerearth, codechef and hackerrank are universal interview cures. If you're someone who's very interested in coding or someone who practices well on these platforms, you definitely have an edge over others.
The interview depends a lot on the panel you get into. Some are very chill while others are extremely, you know, scary. Make sure you know what you write in your resume. Another tip is, if you've done online courses on Coursera, edx, udemy or pluralsight, do mention them in your resume if your resume looks empty.
There are a lot of good sites which provide good templates for a decent resume. Try not to mention about the projects and skills that you're not really so sure about. 
The interviewers asked me a few questions about data structures like b trees, and to write pseudo code for a few basic algorithmic questions. They were also interested in some online course on my resume and we discussed that for a while. This was the tech round and I had an HR round afterwards. They just asked a few common questions with common expected answers.
The results came the next day and they selected around 8 interns.
I'm currently interning at JPMC. If you have any general doubts, feel free to ping me.
Your positive attitude will be an added advantage in all your tests.
So, good luck. :)

AUTHOR : SHIVANI
So it was an initial coding and aptitude round
- Basic dp programme and the usual aptitude round, anyone solving 1 programming question was shortlisted 
- the interview round was mostly about what's in the resume  
One has to have complete idea on what's written in it . Everyone was asked this one question 'what have u done other than ur academics and curriculum projects ' 
I had my participation in sports and android apps that I developed in summer to talk about ...discussion on these took a long time
Jpmc mostly concentrates on designs … Software development cycle design patterns and all those theory concepts.. I was asked to apply those on an example application ' cash transfers through whatsapp'
Preparation  for jpmc 
-Software design 
-No jargons on or when u talk about your work in resume ... they can just see through when someone's bluffing 
- do something technical out of the projects that u could talk  of.. internships too do the trick
Total selected candidates :
8 I guess !! It already took  7 during 3-1 They were given ppos
Just want to advice
Have something technical u could talk about.. not just course ones... in short try to stand out..technically!!

I got a PPO from JP Morgan Chase and Co, so I'll be writing about my internship interview experience. The process started with a written test consisting of aptitude, language, and simple programming questions. 
On qualifying this preliminary round, we had two interviews. The first was with two experienced JPMC employees. The questions were based on tech, but it wasn't centered on data structures and algorithms. One of the DSA questions was a simple one regarding linked list insertion. There were a few questions related to joins in database management systems. Apart from these questions, the interview was mainly a conversation on Ubuntu (which I mentioned is the OS I use). We were talking about how the new update felt (16.04 had just come out) and why I preferred unity over gnome. I was also asked about the recent trends in technology I knew about to which I was only able to give a vague answer.
I wasn't able to give completely correct answers to the DBMS questions and the recent trends question, but since I was selected, I believe that it isn't important to know everything. What really matters, in my opinion, is to cover all your bases, go into the interview room with a smile and be confident and polite.

ASSOCIATE SOFTWARE ENGINEER
AUTHOR : K C JOSEPH 
<joseph.kc96@gmail.com> 
There were four rounds.
The first round was a coding test consisting of aptitudes question and one coding question.
Coding question was related to finding the minimum distance from one point to another with a constraint (that I don't remember).
The second round was a technical interview (one to one).
Started with asking questions about the project which I have mentioned in the resume. They asked me what were the flaws in the project and how I can resolve it. Also asked about the internship which I have done.
At last, they asked me a question "There are n inputs (1<n<10^10) and each input can be a number between 1 and 10^5. Which data structure will be suitable to store these inputs so that finding how many times a number has occurred will be easier?". Beginning I told them BST but if inputs are in an order (say increasing order) then BST will not be suitable. At last, I told AVL tree and they were satisfied with that.
The third round was a manager interview(one to one)
The round started with an informal talk about the life the campus. Then asked about the family background and some other informal talk. Then they asked about the internship and focused on the concept of Big Data which I have done as part of the internship. Then she gave me a white paper and asked to improve one of my project(Registration software for Tathva) by adding more functionalities. She gave me 10 minutes to think and write. After that, they asked me about the cub math which I have mentioned in the resume and what are the activities done by the club.
The fourth round was an HR interview (one to one)
This round was mainly focusing on the communication part. They asked me to explain about myself. Why did I take CSE? What role will you take in a team project? Are you planning to go for higher studies? And so on. Actually, they were not so important with the flow in my communication, which I was facing in the interviews. They gave me enough time in answering the question. They just wanted me to answer.
The company was actually using most of the technologies available presently. So whatever technologies and programming languages which we know, they will be using it. They will be asking questions from them by referring our resume. So be thorough with everything written in the resume. And make sure that you know what all you have written in it. The officials who came for the interview for very friendly and interview process was somewhat informal.
And make sure that you will ask some question to them when they ask whether we have any questions to ask. Follow this while sitting for every company
Rough stats:
The cutoff was 7 cgpa
There were 12 students shortlisted
5 reached till the final round
4 were selected
All 5 reached were from CS
Out of 4 selected one is Mtech and others are Btech

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
AUTHOR : SAI KARTHIK 
<saikarthik1211@gmail.com> 
It has been ages since Microsoft visited NITC, the previous year being 2011. It was the first week of September when we heard that Microsoft will be taking interns from NITC. 
Preparation:
The preparation for the preliminary round is usually simple as the questions asked are quite easy and are usually on data structures and basic dynamic programming. 
For further rounds algorithms from CLRS and going through company based previous interview questions is a must.
On-Campus preliminary round
The preliminary round was conducted in CCC and was hosted on CoCubes with a time duration of 90 minutes. There were 3 questions:
1. Longest Common Subsequence Problem.
2. Merge two sorted linked lists with a twist.
3. Some basic question which I don’t remember.
The scoring was based on both the time and space complexity of the solution and based on the results, 12 members were selected for the further rounds.
Microsoft didn’t visit the campus and requested the candidates to visit Microsoft Research in Bangalore  for further rounds. 
Off Campus Selections
There were around 50 students from NIT Surathkal, BMS Bangalore, IIIT Bangalore and Nit Calicut and we were briefed about our future role in the company and the selection procedure started. 
Paper and Pen Coding round:
The first round was a paper and pen coding round which we were given 45 minutes to solve. It had 3 questions:
1. Find the missing number in an array with n-1 elements having the first n natural numbers.
2. A question on recursive Linked Lists.
3. A mathematical question with a lot of edge cases to handle.
25 members were filtered to proceed for further rounds.
Interview Rounds:
There were 3 interview rounds and an additional fourth round was conducted if further analysis was required. The interviews were one on one interviews and the interviewers were the SDE’s from the same office.
First Interview Round:
The first interview round I had discussions about my interests, previous projects and about the curriculum of NITC and then a series of questions were asked and the solution had to be implemented on paper.
1. Deleting a node in linked list given the pointer to only the current to be deleted node.
2. Mirror a tree and check if it’s the correct mirror or not.
3. Width of a Tree
4. Logical question: Given a rope which burns in an hour how do you know when 15 minutes have passed by?
Second Interview Round:
As soon as I entered the room, I was asked to solve the questions and there was no further discussion involved.
1. Reducing the search space 2 dimensionally and searching an element in a 2D array.
2. A question on shortest path with a modification.
3. Binary search with zeroes in between the elements.
Third Interview Round:
This one had two real life scenarios which the clients approached Microsoft with and I had to solve them. No clues were provided in coming up the solutions unlike previous rounds as this is a real-world scenario.
1. Make an app for preschool kids such that the kid is given random set of letters from alphabets and he has to keep adding letters to form a word from the database. After each letter the app must notify whether the kid is reaching towards a word from the database or not. A front-end engineer has already implemented an interface for the app and we must design how the rest of the app works.
2. There is a low bandwidth network to be laid out connecting a company’s offices throughout its operating zone. Provided with a map, figure out a cost-effective way of implementing this network. 
After this we were told that the results have been forwarded to the T&P cell of our institute.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
AUTHOR : ABHIRAM HARIDAS

Leading up to the interview...
Microsoft was a surprise. Nobody had expected them to show up. But they did (just for interns though). This was after a few companies had already visited campus. I had attended two different interviews before Microsoft. I got to the last round for one and received an offer for the other. Those interviews were completely different from each other so I didn’t really know what to expect for Microsoft. 
I had pretty good faith in my DSA knowledge and had a decent résumé (made using the modern CV template in overleaf.com). But I had never really practised competitive coding. This was a serious weakness considering the fact that most of the hiring procedure revolve around problem solving similar to coding competitions. So before the online round, I would look up the STL syntax (I use C++ for coding) and few other syntactic things that I always tend to forget like functions for string manipulation, input parsing etc. ‘Cracking the Coding Interview’ and ‘GeeksForGeeks’ turned out to be invaluable resources that gave me the right perspective about the hiring procedure. 
Online Round
There was an initial online screening round. This was conducted at the CCC. To be honest, I don’t remember any of the questions in that round. My friend Karthik who has written an issue for interview diaries recollects that there were 3 coding questions hosted on CoCubes (Microsoft’s own platform). The duration was 90 minutes. He recollects that one of the questions were on the longest subsequence problem and the other on merging linked lists. Now to add to that, I remember that the each of the questions had different maximum marks. And not all of us had the same set of questions. There were around 3 or 4 sets of questions.
One marked difference from other coding rounds that I had previously attended was that the test cases they used were minimal. There were very few test cases (around 3 per problem) and it was informed that they would test our code against complicated test cases later on. This was different from the usual ones where our code was tested against challenging test cases then and there. So for Microsoft, there was no guarantee that our code would clear the later test cases even if it cleared all the test cases given there.
Since Microsoft did not visit the campus, 12 shortlisted students were invited for interviews at their Bangalore office. All of us did have a good time and the trip alone was a pleasant experience.
FIRST ROUND
There were around 50 students from various colleges for the interviews and we had no idea about how many interns, they had planned to hire.
We were taken to halls, with around 7-8 of us in one hall. Karthik mentions the questions of this round in his article, so I’m not repeating it here. But I remember that it was the same for all of us. While giving us the questions, we were specifically asked to write solid code that takes care of all the corner cases and error situations. This was something that I had heard Microsoft was very specific about. I spent a lot of time on each question to make sure that it was solid, that i didn’t have enough time to complete the third question. So I was skeptical about getting through to the next round. But fortunately I did.
SECOND ROUND
This was a face to face interview with one of their engineers. There were 3 questions and it lasted around 45 minutes.
An array manipulation question (which i don't remember exactly) that had some kind of insertions, deletions sorting etc. 
Shortest path problem on a graph, although it was put forward as a real world scenario involving traffic intersections.
A basic DP problem very similar to the beginner (coin sum) problem here.
I had struggled with the first problem, some parts of it. But my interviewer really helped me out. He gave me hints and directed my thinking and I eventually reached the solution. I used the Dijkstra’s algorithm for the second one. I immediately abstracted the problem to the familiar shortest path problem from the complicated problem statement. I didn’t have to code the solution. I just had to explain the algorithm. For the third problem, although I knew he expected DP, I started out with a simple recursive solution because I thought I might make mistakes if I tried DP straight away. He asked me what the complexity of the solution was. I said that it is going to be exponential and it can be improved using DP by saving the values into an array. 
At the end he asked me if I had any questions. I asked a couple of questions regarding how interns worked there.
THIRD ROUND
This was a face to face interview. There were three questions and lasted around 45 minutes .
A matrix manipulation question, which involved making specific rows and columns all 0 depending on certain conditions.
A question on linked list which involved deleting nodes.
A logical question, Given a cake (standard slicable cake) cut it into 8 equal parts with just 3 slices.
Again I struggled on the first question. I gave a solution which was suboptimal and he wanted me to improve it. I did suggest a few ways to improve it but he had something else in mind. I had given up and he explained his solution. But I managed to convince him that it was no different from one of my improvements although it did not appear to be so. Before the next question he asked me whether I was comfortable with trees. I said no. So he asked the question on linked list. I managed to do it but I did get some help from him. Before the third question he asked me whether I liked solving puzzles. My answer was no again. That was quite embarrassing, but he took it lightly and asked me an easy one. I managed to solve it after some thought.
This round also ended with an opportunity to ask questions which I used to get some information about the Microsoft work culture. We also spoke briefly about what I had done during my previous internship.
FINAL ROUND
This was a face to face interview with a senior employee at Microsoft. He had spoken to us during the briefing session in the morning. This session lasted around 30 minutes.
There was just one coding question. This was to merge two sorted singly linked list removing duplicates. The catch was that repeating numbers had to be eliminated completely. Not even a single occurrence should be present in the final list. He asked me how much time I would need to do this. I said 15 minutes and started writing the code. After a while he interrupted me (seeing my code) and asked me not to use extra space which he had not mentioned earlier. I rewrote my code. I presented my answer and while explaining the solution. I realized that there were a few issues with my solution. He gave me a few minutes to think about it and told me I did not have to rewrite the solution again. I finally managed to arrive at a solution. I explained it and he was satisfied. He asked me to give 5 test cases and identify the parts of code that they were intended to test. I did so.
After this he had two questions for me. The first one was about the most difficult problem I had solved. I didn’t really have an answer for that. I asked him whether I could talk about some development bug that I had faced. And I explained two issues I had faced during some projects and how I managed to solve them. The last question was ‘Why do you want to work at Microsoft?’ I had thought about this question beforehand and my answer was along the lines that, Microsoft was synonymous with software and Windows would probably be the first piece of software that i had ever laid my hands on and the scale at which they operate is truly phenomenal etc.
I was again given an opportunity to ask questions. I had run out of questions so I went with, ‘What is the best thing about working at Microsoft?’ He had seventeen years of experience at Microsoft and his answer was about the learning curve and the people you get to work with. 
That was the end of the interviews. We got the results before we left Bangalore the next day. Three of us had made it through.
SOME IMPORTANT TAKEAWAYS
The following statements are completely my personal opinion. You might get substantially different advice from others with different perspective.
It’s mostly about competitive coding or algorithmic problem solving ability. But the questions that are asked are not as difficult as the ones you see in coding competitions. There are certain topics and concepts (like DP) that are repeated over and over again. Once you cover them and few famous problems, then almost all questions are some variations of them. Practice on coding platforms to get familiar with the environment and to understand what last minute preparation you’ll need before the actual test.
Although your résumé (with your projects, experience and CGPA) is important, what really matters is your performance during the interviews. During my interviews, I just had very brief discussions about my projects or experiences. But they might use them to differentiate between two people who have performed equally well in the interviews. So you don’t have to worry about not having a great CGPA or enough projects in your résumé. But make sure you don’t bluff. It’s really bad if you end up not knowing about something in your résumé.
Practise coding using pen and paper. It’s surprisingly very different from coding on a terminal or IDE. You don’t have automatic code completion, indentation etc You cannot use Google for syntax references or insert code in between like a text editor.
Research the company. Look up their website. Look them up in GeeksForGeeks. Read previous experiences. Solve previously asked questions. If possible talk to someone who had attended their interviews. Have a lot of questions for interviewers. Almost all of them give you an opportunity to ask questions. Think about genuine questions beforehand. Think about how to answer questions like ‘Why do you wanna work here?’ or to ‘Introduce yourselves’ or ‘What are your strengths and weaknesses?’. Although they can easily spot a made up answer, having a well thought of answer is substantially different from an off-hand answer.
THINK OUT LOUD. During every round of my interview, i was having trouble at some point. The interviewers can really help you out. But only if you explain your thinking process. Explain exactly what you are finding difficult to accomplish. A good strategy is to start with a suboptimal solution. Getting to such solutions are generally easy even for difficult problems. You can gradually improve it. You might even end up not having to write code for the improved solution if you explain it well enough. And you never know, the interviewer might not be expecting a better solution.
Hope my experiences and my conclusions from them help you to be better prepared for your internship opportunities. I recommend going through as many articles as possible to get a better perspective of the big picture.
All the best for all your efforts !

<navak@disroot.org>
- How was the interview process? How many rounds were there? Were they all technical?
I have not sat for the MS 4y interviews, so better get specifics about the interview process from someone else. Not all rounds were technical, there was an HR round, and there was a group activity round were the students were divided into two groups and were asked to make some product and market it.
- How was the questions in each round? Were they focusing on any technology or concept?
When I interned there, what I understood is that the firm gives a lot of importance to software engineering and design. If you are selected for the interviews, you must spend a lot of time revising software engineering. Most probably, there is going to be an entire round for this, and don't be unprepared. I'll post a few sample questions, so that you get an idea about what to expect.
(This is, if you clear the other technical rounds)
- How did you prepare for the test? Do you think you should do something differently or focus on something specific during preparation?
Again, SE. Know how to draw class diagrams. Know the basics. Composition, Aggregation, association, interfaces, abstract classes, singleton classes, all these things, have a clear idea not just about what they are, but also about how and where to use them. Design Patterns.
-  Number of people selected?
Five - Hamza, Sumedha, Himashu Tiwari, Shubham Jain.
- Had you interned here? If yes, what was the interview experience?
PPO peeps, be professional.
There is going to be a selection process at the end, and don't expect everyone to get an offer.
What is the difference between composition and aggregation? (My interviewer asked me a lot of questions on this point, went into the very finer details, we discussed using multiple examples and he made sure I knew the concept well)
You will be asked to design a software, i.e draw class diagrams. Somehow get hold of questions and answers from a good source, and practice. When designing, give a lot of thought into it, and make good design choices. Also, use all those stuff I mentioned in the first post. Try to impress the interviewer.
Also look into ER diagrams.
Sample question:
Suppose you are designing an e-commerce  website. You have to design a search and apply filter system. There will be products. Identify ways to filter search results, and design a system to do this.
Design a notebook. (This question is awesome, there is a normal way of designing it, and also a super awesome way)

The interview consisted of four rounds:
Round 1 (Technical): Basic questions from operating systems, data structures and algorithms, and a few SQL queries were asked. A few puzzle questions were also asked, like if a fly started crawling from the top right corner of the room to the bottom left, what's the shortest path it could take. They also asked me my favorite subject.
Round 2 (Legos): Here, we were divided into two teams, and had to come up with an idea, prototype it with legos, and present it on chart paper to our "investors". They grilled us with questions like who the team leader was, and who we would be willing to kick out of the team. No one got eliminated in this round.
Round 3 (HR): Wow. It started with general stuff like asking me about my hobbies and why I chose CS. But then the interviewer started asking me a lot of questions about whether I'd show my answers to other people during a test. And every time I answered, my decisions were challenged. It was long and grueling, but I managed to get through in the end. Oh, and word of advice- don't just know the names of their CEO and founders, know how to pronounce them too.
Round 4 (Technical): Here, they gave me a hypothetical scenario (Tech Fest in our college, for example), and asked me to design various tables required to store information. I had to build tables for, among others, the participants and the programmes, making sure they had all the relevant columns. I also had to make sure the tables were normalized and flexible to change. I was guided through this process. Then, they gave me another scenario (students staying late outside hostels), and I had to do the same thing by myself. In the end, I was asked questions about the work I did during my internship and also if I had any questions for them.
The last round is especially important, so make sure you're familiar with database normalization. Also, it might be helpful to have an idea for the lego round beforehand. And as usual, knowledge of basic CS stuff is important.
This time, they had conducted a workshop in which we started out by writing a small program, to which they kept asking us to add more and more features. I was directly selected from this workshop and didn't have to write the test.
Number of people selected - 3 from B.Tech, 2 from M.Tech (for full time)
CTC - 16LPA
I just brushed up on some CS stuff like DSA, OS and c programming and went and wrote. It was a simple test for the workshop

My interview experience with Societe Generale- 3 Aug 2017
Interviews and placements can be a very stressful period for all and it is important to keep your calm and stay focused. It's also important to motivate yourself and to believe that your day will surely come because not everyone is going to get placed in their first attempt and surely the number of yellow cards piling up and the decreasing size of the candidate pool never helps.
Every recruitment process is a slight variation of the normal procedure: A preliminary test and an interview. Let me share with you my interview experience with Societe Generale.
Online tests, presentations, and interviews are never the best things on earth but the feeling after you get placed, can be. With almost no time to breathe and back to back interviews, keeping your hopes up and still trying to put your best self forward every morning is sure going to a daunting task.
This is exactly how things were, when I went to attempt the Online tests for Societe General right after being rejected after my first interview. The online test on HirePro platform consisted of 50 questions. 25 aptitude questions concentrated on profit, loss, and graph interpretation in addition to math puzzles. 25 technical questions including questions on OS, DBMS and C++ concepts, like OOPS and bit manipulation ( left and right shift operator). After the presentations next day they shortlisted around 60 people. Their recruitment process started off with a GD round where they split us into 5 groups of 12 people each. The interviewer asked us for ideas on topics and he chose from the options we gave. This probably was our first chance to make an impression.
Amongst the various suggestions made, were topics like “Startups: boon or a bane”, “Demonetization”, “GST”. Most of us take a GD to be synonymous to a debate. It is not and the interviewer is always quick to note that. Always make sure to let people speak and agree with them if you do. It isn’t always necessary to counter their suggestions or points. Be assertive and make sure you know things you speak and be careful to not start a controversy.
They shortlisted 36 people after the GD for the first round of technical interviews.
My first round of interview consisted of questions which aimed at testing my coding skills. When they are done asking you 2-3 questions, they move on to your areas of interest and also a discussion on final year project ideas. One of the two interviewers worked in security. My final year project being “Android malware detection”, he asked me a few questions and it led on to a very interesting discussion on the same, with both of us talking about ideas and the different aspects of the problem. My second interview was a managerial round with another interviewer. He asked me about my internship projects and other activities I had taken up. The discussion then switched to newer technologies and how much I was familiar with them. They certainly were looking for candidates who had an idea of what was happening around and not just theories from the textbooks. But knowing your concepts well, certainly helps, because at the end of the day that is what gets you the job. Always make sure that your resume has things you very well know about because you are answerable to anything and everything in it. My third interview was the HR round with the usual set of questions like “why should we hire you?”, “which is your most preferred location?” etc. But what caught the interviewer was my hobby. He asked me to write an essay after I told him I love to read and I occasionally write poems and short stories. He further asked me a few more general questions and explained to me the working of the organization. This is when I realized that had I lied about it, I would have gotten into trouble. But this time, I was safe.
Now came the most dreaded part of the evening. Yes, that's right, none of us realized that we had spent 12 hours straight, from 8 in the morning to 8 in the evening inside TnP. We had to wait for the results. There were 8 of us who made it to the HR.
Another half an hour later they came and gave 4 of us our offer letter and welcomed us into their company. This certainly as I said earlier is the best feeling on earth. At the end of the journey, you are left with rich experiences, positive learnings and a heart filled with mixed emotions.
If I had to tell someone some quick tips, then this would be it:
“Apart from all the algorithms and concepts you have mastered, there are a few other things that can help you get through. Always remember to smile and put your best self forward. “Do not” ever let someone or something dishearten you. Speaking loud and clear, and not beating around the bush when answering the questions will definitely leave a better impression because it is all about creating an impression and looking different from the rest. Remember, the better you present yourself, the better are the chances of grabbing the offer. “
P.S: If anyone reading this is preparing for an interview, all the very best. :)

The interview process for tally solutions was pretty chill. It involved four rounds of testing. The first one was an online MCQ questionnaire which focused on aptitude and algorithms. It checked on the basic c,c++ knowledge. There were 3 basic output questions also at the end.Of the 150 students who attempted the test, approximately 30 students were shortlisted to the Group Discussion round. We were split into groups of 10. Our group got the topic “Whether extracurricular activities should be made compulsory in our curriculum?”. You are supposed to make valid statements here but more than that they expect you to speak anything with confidence. 21 were shortlisted to the next round which was supposed to be technical. There were two interview rooms where technical interviews were going on parallelly. My interview tested my basic coding skills. Here they didn’t just want the algorithm, they wanted the proper code. A lot of aptitude questions were asked. They were more concerned at my approach to these questions rather than the correctness of my solutions. Apart from those they asked me about my hobbies, the books I have read (even asked me to narrate one of the stories). A few theoretical questions based on DBMS and OS were also asked. 8 students were shortlisted to HR round. HR around did not really involve any HR related questions. It was more of a learning session. The manager kept asking about complex OS processes to which I did not know answers to. But he explained to me all those processes and asked me to learn these before joining the company. You are free to ask him any questions regarding the company, their training process, etc. Also, it’s a plus point for you to show that you are interested in knowing more about their company. Finally, 7 students were selected into Tally Solutions.
P.S: Coding knowledge alone is not enough. Be aware of your surroundings. Once you get through to the HR round, you are almost safe. :p

<amaljose96@gmail.com>
The first round was a coding round. There were 3 coding questions. I was able to get all test cases on one question (a dynamic programming question). I got a few test cases on another question.
The next day, they selected 3 of us for the interviews because only we had done at least one of the 3 coding questions.
There were 3 interview rounds. All three rounds were partially HR and technical. 
The first interviewer asked me about Data structures. Questions related to stacks, queues, algorithms like BFS, DFS. Then I was given a question to solve on the spot. They also asked HR questions like why I need the job, what all clubs I'm a part of in college etc.
The second interviewer asked me about my internship experience at Goldman Sachs. He also asked questions related to databases.
The third interviewer asked me about networks. He also asked a few HR questions like how long would I be in the company and even suggested that I go for higher studies. I told firmly that I'd work for 2 years and then go for higher studies. Then he told me I'm selected.
Only I got selected into Tesco.
Preparation tips
1. Take DAA as an elective in 5th semester, or be thorough with algorithms and data structures. Questions related to stacks, queues, circulars queues need to be practiced. These can be revised by using coding platforms like Codechef or Hackerrank.
2. To get into interview rounds, one has to clear the coding round. Practice in platforms like Codechef and Hackerrank is recommended to get into those first coming, high paying companies.

Preparation
I read interview experiences of my seniors to know about the type of questions they were asking and I could find most of those questions in ‘geeksforgeeks’. So I practiced many questions from ‘geeksforgeeks’ which was really helpful for my tests and interviews. I also read some part of the book ‘cracking the coding interview’.
Online Test
The first round was an online test which was conducted in CCC. There were multiple choice questions, mostly aptitude type. And there were questions related to programming languages and OOP concepts also.
Online Interview
From the online test, 12 people got shortlisted for the next round which was an online interview. I had already attended two interviews before this, which helped me to prepare well for this one.
The interviewer asked me about the programming languages I knew and which one I was preferring. Then he started asking the questions. These were some of the questions : 
1. Find the elements in an array which appears more than once(have duplicates)
e.g.: array = [22, 32, 27, 78 32, 89 78, 32]
elements having duplicates = 32, 78
2. Reverse a sentence word-wise without using extra space
e.g.: “welcome to nitc” will be reversed as “nitc to welcome”
3. How to store the names of different people as in a dictionary (which data structure to use and why)
I had to write the pseudocode for these in a text box provided in the interview window.
 
There was no HR round.
After the interview, 5 people got selected for the internship.
 
These are some of the mistakes I made in my previous interviews which you should not make:
In my first interview, the interviewer asked me a question and he gave me a pen and paper to write the answer. So I thought he was expecting the program code and I started writing the code without even telling him how I was going to solve the problem.
— When you get the problem, first you have to tell your approach to solve the problem.   Then if it is required you can write the pseudocode, not the entire program code.
The interviewer asked me if I knew about the heap data structure. I had learnt about it previously but had forgotten most of that. I also didn’t learn it before coming to the interview. Even then I told the interviewer that I knew about heap data structure. Then he gave me one problem from heap which I couldn’t solve.
— Most of the times, the interviewer will ask questions only from what you know. So if he asks you whether you know about something, you have to say yes only if you have a thorough knowledge of that. 
 
Some points I learnt from my interview experience:
When they give you a problem to solve, even if the first answer that comes to your mind is not that efficient or of high complexity just say that answer. Don’t think that you’ll find a better solution and then you’ll tell the answer. They’re not expecting the most efficient solution from you (It’s good if you have one), but they want to know the way you approach a problem. Later they might ask you to reduce the complexity of your answer. Then you can think again and find a better answer. The point is you have to go step by step to your final solution which will help the interviewer to understand your thinking process better.
Don’t sit there for a long time thinking about the solution (without saying anything). If it takes too long, just say what you’re thinking.
Ask questions to know your problem better.

There was only one round and that was on video conferencing. All the questions were technical. 
Most of the questions were based on the projects we mentioned in CV. A few questions were related to OOP concepts. One algorithm question was about creating queue using two stacks.
I haven't prepared much for the interview. I think it's better to have a clear idea of the projects and languages we mention in CV. They cover almost all topics in CV and some basic DSA questions and OOP concepts. 
Cgpa cutoff: 7
No.of interns selected was 5

There is a PPO offer and I think it's based on our performance in the company.

Thermo Fisher had sent us some projects that they wanted to give to the interns, and we could choose our preference, which I found helpful to see what kind of work I'd be doing there. 
In the first round, there was a multiple-choice quiz with questions from DBMS, basic DSA(stacks, queues, etc), language-specific questions for Java and Python, which was unusual (eg. how constructors are implemented in Java)
The interview was a video call, and they asked mostly about my projects. Tip: They'll be impressed if you've done good projects, but only if you really know what you're talking about.
Another Tip: Google some commonly asked questions, prepare answers before you go. I know it seems silly to prepare 'tell me about yourself' and 'what's your favorite subject', but during an interview you may blank out, and these are the best questions to stand out to the interviewer, even if you aren't the best coder.
The coding question was to implement a doubly-linked list in any language. The interview was very relaxed and friendly. Tip: At the end of the interview, if they ask you if you have any questions, make sure you ask! It shows your interest and helps you learn about the company. Google some questions to ask.
I had also sat for the JP Morgan interview, where there were two interviewers, and they were more intimidating. Tip: Prepare for any kind of interviewer. Some interviewers won't smile, won't react, and won't do anything to let you know if you're doing well or not. I kept trying to deflate the tension with jokes... don't do that. Just answer the questions calmly and at your own pace. Often the interviewer is just trying to see how you'll handle yourself under pressure. They just want to see you be confident in your answers. I personally think it's a terrible way to 'see how we handle pressure', but you don't get to choose your interviewer!
Stipend was 12,000 per month, for two months. 14 people got past the first round, 5 were selected after the interview. No mention of PPO yet.
About a month into the internship, a few things I feel about the company: They're primarily a biotech company, not a software company. They won't be constantly on the 'bleeding edge' of software development, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The employees are pretty chill, and it's overall a friendly atmosphere to work in. You can actually learn a lot.
Most important tip: Use your summer wisely. A great personal project may help you get placed better than an internship.

An online test which mostly included questions on basics of java, python, javascript, C output questions and questions on DBMS transactions, 1 or 2 questions on networks IP address,etc.
Following that, there was an online interview for shortlisted students which was for 30 minutes.
I had 2 interviewers. First person asked questions on javascript, HTML, CSS, etc.
The second person asked one coding question and asked me to write pseudocode for it. It was a simple question which took 5 min to solve.
Following that, he asked me one logical question, like some water jug question.
The interview was technical. We didn't have an HR round.
They selected us based on the technical round.

CGPA CUTOFF: 7 
Branches: CS, EC
CTC: 7.53 LPA
Screening test
There were 30 technical questions. For each question 3 minutes were given to answer. If you don't answer within 3 minutes the question disappears. You cannot answer it later. 
Areas focused: Operating System, DBMS, programming related questions
21 students were selected for the interview process.
Interview Round 1 - Technical
As DBMS and DSA were mentioned as my favourite subjects, the questions were asked on those topics first.
DBMS:  
… Normalisation 
DSA: 
…Which technique do you prefer, quick sort or merge sort? 
Then I was asked to write merge sort algorithm on the paper. 
(They ask you to write the code in order to test whether you mugged up or you really understood the concept.) 
… What's the difference between a++ and ++a?
… Algorithm to reverse a string
Operating System:
… What happens when you execute an malloc?
Around 10-12 students headed to the next round
Interview Round 2 - HR
… family details
… why CS
… why NIT Calicut
… hobbies
and other related questions
When they ask whether you have any questions to ask them, don't say no. Ask them something or just tell them what all you like about their company. 
This makes them understand that you know something about them and they'll get to know that you are interested in the job.
Finally, 3 people (1 CS, 1 EC and 1 M Tech CS) got placed.
Whatever you talk to them, please talk confidently. Don't let them underrate you based on your tone. This suggestion is from my personal experience.

<raj.uddhav2509@gmail.com>
 
Cut-Off: 6.5 CGPA
Qualification Rounds:
1. Online MCQ round
There were 4 sections:
Reasoning, Puzzles, Computer Fundamental and DSA questions, Language specific questions
Time- 1 hr 30 min,  No Negative Marking
At first I solved the Computer Fundamental and DSA questions and the language specific questions. As I am comfortable with Java, I chose it as my preferred language. Puzzles were intriguing and interesting. I was not able to complete the reasoning part (though I made blind guesses :P) so I don’t remember the complexity but as I heard it from my friends, it was easy.
Some DSA questions-
Finding the cost of minimum spanning tree in a given graph
Performing postorder and preorder traversal, constructing binary tree from given postorder and preorder traversal (It is possible only when the tree is full)
Basic questions on stacks ,queues and BSTs
Tips to crack this section: Study and have command over any language of your choice ( preferably an OOP language). Go through the popular questions asked on that particular language. Have good conceptual knowledge of the data structures. Practice some reasoning questions and probability questions before the test.
2. Coding Round
This round happened just after the MCQ test. Only students who got the minimum cut off marks in the MCQ test were allowed to write the coding test.
Time-30 minutes    No of questions-1   Difficulty Level-Easy
Question- Given a binary tree check whether it is a Symmetric Binary Tree i.e., a mirror to itself.
Tips to crack this section: Practice competitive coding on Hackerrank and Codechef. Also go through GeeksForGeeks for the popular questions asked by companies.
Interview Rounds:
1. Technical Interview
18 people were shortlisted for the 1st Round of Interview. It was over the phone and purely technical.
At first the interviewer started with basic questions like tell me about yourself and the areas that I am comfortable in. He was very cool and was helping me when I was stuck at some point. Most of the questions were from Operating Systems and Networking and very less from Data Structures.
Operating System Questions-
What is Demand Paging? He wanted the full explanation along with examples.
Differences between Process and Thread.
Explain Virtual Memory.
What is deadlock?
He asked something about memory partition which I don’t remember (And also, I was not able to answer this XD).
Networking Questions-
What are the layers in OSI reference models. Describe each one briefly.
Which is more reliable TCP or UDP?
Does DNS work on TCP or UDP. Explain the mechanism.
Explain DHCP. What happens when DHCP server is down.
Differences between IPv4 and IPv6.
Advantages of having a proxy server.
DSA questions-
Delete nth node from the end of a linked list in one pass
There was one question on doubly linked list which I don’t remember but it was easy.
It was a short round of 15 minutes.
Tips to crack this section: Have a good grasp over the concepts of Operating System and Networking. Think out loud. Tell the interviewer what you are thinking. Often interviewers are very friendly and will help you as and when needed. Most of the questions asked are popular questions in that subject. Make sure you go through them before the interview.
2. HR Round
9 people were shortlisted for the HR Round. 
The interviewer started with questions like where I was from and what are my hobbies. 
He asked me to speak on cryptocurrencies for 2 minutes.
Principles of Computer Security
Then there were some questions related to my projects. I had chatbot, XOS and some web dev projects. He asked me questions like in which project you faced maximum difficulty, how did you overcome that, why did you choose to do that project etc.
I had mentioned in my resume that I was on the technical experts team in Software Engineering Lab. So there were questions like how did you manage people, what was your job,etc. What if a particular person is not doing his job despite telling him multiple times.
He gave me a situation where the project manager is taking credits for all the work that I have done. How will I act.
Then I was asked to give my views on the topic “Can Law be Wrong” .
He asked about my extracurricular activities to which I told him all about streetplay. He was really impressed by this and wanted to know what topics we show generally.
Tips to crack this section: This is a round where you can anticipate most of the questions beforehand. Be thorough with your projects and be confident on whatever you have written in your resume. The interviewer will try to put you in difficult situations. During the interview he told me that I have scored very less in my technical interview and asked me the reason. But when everything was over he told me my marks were fine and this was just a test. So be prepared for everything.
In the end,4 people were selected from CSE.
Preparation:
Data Structures and Algorithms by Narasimha Karumanchi is a good book for last minute references.
Practice competitive coding as every company has coding as the first round.
Have at least one or two good projects and make sure you know about every aspect of what you have done.
Do company specific preparation before the tests.
Other Tips:
Your resume is your mirror. Make it crisp. Add all that you have done and avoid putting things you won’t be able to answer.
There will always be rejections. Don’t be dejected. Be ready to face them and learn from each one of them. 
Be confident and relaxed. (Kind of obvious but people generally get tensed).
It’s okay to say NO when you don’t know the answer and is better than just blabbering stuffs you have no idea about.
P.S.- All the best to everyone reading this. GodSpeed. Chillax!!

Online Test
The first round was an online test with four sections. Since the recruiters hadn't come to campus, and therefore couldn't directly invigilate us for the test, they had asked we activate our webcams on our computers so that, once we finished the test, they could watch us attempting it.
The first section of the online test was English. 
The second was math and logic.
 The third section contained program output questions, some of which were based on pointers. 
We were only allowed to go on to the fourth section, which consisted of one coding question, if we answered enough questions correctly on the first two sections. The coding question was different for different people. 
EG. Given two numbers, find their least common prime factor.
Technical Interview
Only those students who had managed to get to the coding question were asked to come for the technical interview round a few days later. The interview was by phone, and it was only ten to fifteen minutes. The questions were based on Computer Networks and Database Management Systems. 
They had asked us to name the different layers in the TCP/IP model, and they had also asked us which protocol is used to transfer data from host to host.
 From DBMS, the questions were: What is a lock, what are the different modes of a lock, and what is the difference between a read and a write lock. 
Then they had asked us to describe the projects we had done so far, including how many members there had been in our teams and how we had managed teamwork. 
Finally, they asked us whether we were flexible to intern in any location. We had all made sure to say yes to that question.
Some other technical questions from Networks that were asked were: What are the different layers in OSI model, and give a brief description about the network layer in the OSI model. 
From Operating Systems, the questions were based on paging and segmentation, and those who had taken OS Lab were additionally asked if they had come across those concepts in their XOS project. Other OS questions had been related to virtual memory. 
Virtual functions and polymorphism were programming concepts that were also asked in this round.
HR Round
If we passed the technical interview round, we could proceed to the HR round, which was also a phone interview and lasted around twenty minutes. During this, we were asked various situational and hypothetical questions. We were asked to give an example of when we had to learn a specific skill in a short period of time and to describe the obstacles we had overcome during the process. They also asked us where our friends were from and what our opinions were of classmates from various states. Those who are not originally from Kerala were asked to state what they had learned from Kerala culture, and were asked to describe the events we had participated in the college fests. They had also asked us what our hobbies were, and to define a few vocabulary words. 
The technical interview questions were mostly on DBMS, OS, and Computer Networks topics. The questions in the third section of the online test required you to know pointers, arrays, and functions well. To prepare for the HR interview round, we had searched online for possible HR interview questions.
Six students, four from CSE and two from ECE, had been selected for the internship. The CGPA cutoff criterion to be able to attempt the online test was 6.0. Our salary is Rs. 15,000 per month.
We have a final review at the end of the two-month internship. If we do well in the review, we will be offered a PPO. 
Tips related to the company: Be confident. Interns are expected to be assertive, curious, and aware of surroundings, as well as clear in communication and responsible. Focus more on learning than being productive during the two months; work will anyway be assigned to you.
Guidelines for the selection process: Be confident. Know your theory concepts well.

<lalitha.chowdary88@gmail.com> 
Company : Oracle(Server Tech) 
CTC : 22 LPA 
Number of people selected : 4 
Interview Process: 
First Round: 
First round was an online MCQ test for about 2 hours. There were two profiles - application and server tech, and the test was common for both profiles.The test was divided into different sections like aptitude, programming (output questions), operating systems, DBMS & networks and each section had separate time limits. 
Second Round: 
The people shortlisted from the test had a coding round, common for both application and server tech. It consisted of 3 questions which were from dynamic and greedy programming. There were about 10 test cases for each question. The test was for 2 hours. 
Interviews: 
About 25 people were shortlisted for the interview. Interview process for server tech and application were different. Server tech interview had 3 rounds. 
In the 1st round they asked about the coding questions in the previous round, as in how we approached the problems. They asked our areas of interest and asked questions from that particular area. Questions were not so difficult. If you are thorough with the basics it will be easy. 
In the 2nd round of the interview, they asked questions mostly on DBMS, OS and Data structures. From DBMS, normalisation questions and SQL queries were asked. From OS, questions were mostly from memory management. From Data structures, questions were on sorting algorithms, stack, queue and trees. In this round, questions were asked based on our resume as well. Since I had java in my resume, they asked me about java. They will also ask about the projects mentioned in your resume. 
3rd round was HR. They just asked about our interests, basic details and question like ‘why do you want to join us?’, ‘Why should we hire you?’ etc. Be confident in HR round. 
Preparation Method: 
Concentrate more on OS and DBMS. Be perfect with all the concepts in those subjects. If you have done any lab, be prepared with that too. See GeeksforGeeks for previous interview questions and prepare according to that. Practice coding either from hackerrank or hackerearth. For data structures, practice questions on Geeks for Geeks.

SERVER TECH ENGINEER
AUTHOR : NITIN SUKUMAR 
<ntn.sukumar@gmail.com> 
Company: Oracle
Position: Server Tech Engineer
Cut-Off: 7.0 CGPA
CTC: 22 LPA
Qualification Rounds:
1) Online MCQ round
There were 4 sections:
Aptitude, Communication, Computer Fundamentals, Programming.
Individual Timers for each section and sub section were kept and overall timer of 2 hrs. Don't get bogged down by questions and waste your time. Be quick.
Your ability to interpret and analyse data and flowcharts will be checked a lot. For a CS student, fundamentals is going to be an easy section. They require you to understand code in C/Java and answer questions.
2) Coding Round
There were 300 people who wrote the initial test and around 57 were shortlisted for this round. These were the only people eligible for Server Engineer Post.
It had 2 questions and 90 minutes time. The questions were simple, based on arrays and hashing concepts.The interesting part was that there was no time complexity check. So you need to write only correct programs and not necessarily efficient.
Interview Rounds:
1) Around 27 people were shortlisted for the 1st Round of Interview. It was purely technical :
- basic questions like ‘tell me about yourself’
- a review of the previous coding round and optimizations that i could make with my code
- some very basic questions based on BST, hashing, factorial and memory management 
- some Java concepts like threading.
2) Another purely technical round. Around 13 made it to this round.
- code for reversing a linked list.
- about my project on Web development, OS and also about the ethical hacking course I had done.
This was the longest round and they mainly test how strong you are with the technologies mentioned in your resume.
3) 6 made it to this round. It was kind of like a rapid fire with the main interviewer from the company :
- questions on structures, files, web, graphs, etc.
4) HR :
- Tell me about yourself.
- Why Oracle?
- Going for higher studies? (I said not in my current agenda. Work first.)
- about family, etc.
This is one round where you can expect almost 90% of questions beforehand. Be prepared, but don't tell it like you have learned beforehand. Make it natural. They look for genuine answers and not answers filled with high sounding words.
In the end,4 people got selected for the post of Server Engineer.
About Internship :
Didn't go for any internship. Don't think it is really necessary as long as you have good projects to show and you are strong in whatever languages/concepts you know.
Technologies to familiarise:
C/C++/Python/Java, Web development, Web Security.
Although knowing python may not help that much for Oracle, I recommend learning it and doing some projects using python.
Preparation:
- Interview Coding Questions by Narasimha Karumanchi is a gem of a book, highly recommended.
- Hackerrank- practice coding here.
- Internshala- Certification courses on Python/Web/Hacking/AngularJS are good and you can get to do good projects.
Other Tips:
- Resume Should be crisp and to the point. Write only what you know.
- Have a calm and relaxed mind.This is can do wonders for you.
- Be confident. Don't see interview as an elimination process, see it as an opportunity to excel.
- Never get too tensed if you can't answer initially. Your ability to deal with pressure will be checked by the interviewer.
- Remember to see every NO as the Next Opportunity.

SERVER TECH ENGINEER
AUTHOR : DEVIKRISHNA R 
Profile: Server Tech Engineer
Initially an online test was conducted on the Oracle platform, consisting of 4 sections –
Communication Skills, Logical Aptitude,Programming and Computer Science with time limit for each section.
50 students were shortlisted for 2nd round which was a coding test which consisted of 2 coding questions-
Bomb the city: You are given n cities with their city number and bombing range, the program should print YES if 2 cities can bomb each other, otherwise print NO.
Eg: 2
     0 (city number)  2(range)
     2         -2
    Output: YES
Here city 0 can bomb (0+2)2nd city and city 2 can bomb (2-2)0th city. As these 2 cities can bomb each other, program should print YES.
    2. Bilbo’s game: Bilbo has n players with n scores, find the maximum level Bilbo can reach using these n players. Bilbo can reach kth level if 
i. Bilbo has k players with score k.
Ii. Bilbo can combine 2 players into 1 if sum of their scores is equal to k.
Eg: 4
     2 2 3 6
    Output : 2
Here Bilbo has 2 players with score 2, and no level >2 can be reached, so 2 is the highest level.
INTERVIEW:
Be confident and always have a pleasant face. Try to answer the questions and say out loud the approach you are using so that they can help you if you are going the wrong way. Do not say you don’t know the answer immediately on hearing the question. Write codes legibly and explain your answers with examples.
First round- 
26 students were shortlisted for the interviews.
Initially the interviewer asked me to introduce myself and brief him about the projects I did. 
Questions he asked-
What is the approach you chose for solving the coding questions in the previous round and how it can be optimized?
What is the difference between binary tree and graph and give an application of both?
Write a program to print all permutations of a given number.
Eg: 231
Output: 123   132 213 312 321 
Second round-
Out of the 26, 13 were shortlisted for the second round.
There were 2 interviewers and they first asked me to introduce myself and tell them about my projects. 
Questions they asked-
What is XOS and how you made an operating system, what all functionalities were implemented and the theory behind it?
What all functionalities were implemented in the webP project you did and its format?
What all fields should be put in a login page?
What are the components in a URL?
Write a program to find factorial of a number and explain what the defect in the program is.
How to find the maximum value of n such that factorial of n is a value less than maximum value of int datatype?
Given an array of strings, explain the approach you would choose to find whether the string obtained by concatenating 2 other strings from the array is present in the array or not.
Eg: a ball lock joke down lockdown hai
Output: Yes
Here string lockdown is obtained by concatenating strings lock and down.
    8. What is the worst case and best case time complexity of the approach taken in the 
           previous question.
Third round-
6 people were shortlisted for the third round.
There was 1 interviewer and the questions he asked were-
What is a structure?
How do you find the size of a structure?
What is structure padding?
Given a binary tree, write the postfix, prefix and infix traversal results.
What is difference between graph and binary tree?
Fourth round-
I shifted from Server Tech to Application Developer and so had an additional round.
The interviewer asked me to design an application for a class. He also asked to write a function in which professor can cancel classes and the students are immediately notified and another function which returns the number of classes a professor cancelled. I was asked to draw the basic layout of the app and to use data structures to define the various objects involved. I was also asked which mechanism to be used to send messages to all the students when the professor cancelled a class.
HR round-
Be prepared with the answers for the general HR questions, do not say you have plans for higher studies, be frank and show them that you are an enthusiastic and friendly person.
Introduce yourself.
How have you been a good team player and in what all ways have you contributed to the teams you have worked with?
What is your future plan?

SERVER TECH ENGINEER
AUTHOR :  HARITH RATHISH 
Firstly an online test was conducted. 100 candidates were shortlisted for the interview process.
Interview process lasted almost half a day. The level of difficulty increases as you clear each interview.
General Tips for Technical Rounds:
Goes without saying, don’t get tensed. Always maintain eye contact when you’re conversing with the interviewer. Don’t look away in an effort to show that you’re thinking.
While answering a question, THINK OUT LOUD. Start off with the easiest possible solution to a problem (doesn’t matter even if it is a brute force solution. Say it). Then progress slowly to the optimal solution. Whatever optimization you make to your solution, explain what it is and why you did it, to the interviewer. This helps him/her to connect with your thought process and will help him/her to course-correct you if you are approaching a wrong solution.
Interview 1
Type: Technical
Question 1: Write a program to print your name ‘x’ times without using any iterative constructs (for loops, while loops, etc.)
Solution : Use the following recursive function:
def print_name( count, name ):
if(count==0):
return
else:
print(name)
print_name(count-1,name)
Question 2: Output ‘odd’ if a number is odd or ‘even’ if it’s not without using any ARITHMETIC or RELATIONAL operators. This implies no +,-,/,*,% etc. or == or if conditions.
Solution : The interviewer did not say I could use bitwise operators until I asked him.
1. Initialize a list of 2 strings ‘even’ and ‘odd’ in that order. Call the list P
2. Bitwise AND (&) the input number and 1 and call the output X
3. X will be 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers.
4. Use X as an index for list P when outputting the final verdict, whether the number is odd or even
Question 3: You’re given a text document representing the compilation log of a faulty program. Each log entry can indicate either a WARNING or an ERROR along with the corresponding stack trace. Find all the entries which indicate an error and print the corresponding stack trace of that entry. 
This is what a sample ERROR log entry looked like:
[2016-05-04 12:34:24|ERROR|<details_about_the_error>.........................................|<source_file(line_number)
This is what a sample WARNING log entry looked like:
[2016-05-04 12:34:24|WARN|<details_about_the_error>.........................................|<source_file(line_number)
Solution : Using a string matching algorithm, scan the document for the pattern |ERROR|. When such an instance is found, considering that particular log entry, this is what you’re required to print (- indicates concatenation):
Everything that comes before |ERROR| till the last [ - |ERROR| - everything that comes after |ERROR| till the next [
Question 4: Design the data model of an online portal which sells used cars. Draw the entity relationship diagram (ER-diagram). Indicate all the foreign keys, 1-to-1, 1-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
Solution : Identify all the entities in this situation. There are two main entities : USERS and CARS. There has to be a separate table for each of these, each with a primary key (USER_ID and CAR_ID). A user can own multiple used cars, but a used car can be owned by only one user at a time. (USER -> CAR = 1-to-many relationship). These two tables and the relations are important when answering this question. You can add other attributes like maintenance history for each car, what cars each user has used in the past (Again, separate tables for these). Explain the purpose of each table well to the interviewer.
Interview 2
Type: Technical
A few questions on your resume, your previous internships (if you’ve done any) and your areas of interests.
What is normalization? What are the different normal forms? with examples
Question 1: You’re given a completely filled 9x9 Sudoku grid. Write a program to check if it’s the correct solution.
Solution : Maintain 3 categories of hash maps of keys 1-9 (total 9 entries) and 9 copies of each type. The 3 categories are 1 for row (9 copies of that in an array  ROW[9]) , 1 for column (9 copies of that in an array COLUMN[9]) and 1 for a 3x3 neighborhood (NEIGH[3][3]).
Traverse through the grid using two for loops with indices i(row) and j(column)
For each entry a[i][j] in the grid do the following:
1. Change the keys ROW[i], COLUMN[j] and NEIGH[i/3][j/3].
2. If you detect a collision or invalid key while updating any of the above hash maps, it means the solution is incorrect. Break out of the loops and print “Incorrect Solution”
If you never detect a collision or invalid key, then it means the given solution is correct.
Question 2: Design a mobile application which shows the list of candidates currently waiting for an interview. For each candidate also show the following:
-Resume of the candidate
-A list of previous interviews he/she has gone through with interviewer feedback on each of those.
-An option to alert the candidate with a text message when it’s time for the interview
Show the data model, a mockup/wireframe of the front-end (basically how you would design the front end) and what technologies would you use to design the front end.
Solution : Entities are CANDIDATES, INTERVIEWERS and INTERVIEWS. A separate table for each of these entities, each with a primary key. INTERVIEWS table will have 2 foreign keys (one for CANDIDATES and one for INTERVIEWERS) along with the Feedback attribute. CANDIDATES will have a link to the resume document in the Resume attribute, and usual stuff like Candidate Name, Contact No., etc.
Interview 3
Type: Technical/HR
Your hobbies, future plans (where do you see yourself in 5 years), opinion on higher studies.
Questions on your projects, how difficult they were and what would you have done differently.
Question 1: What are the Object-Oriented Programming concepts? Write a program which implements all of these concepts
Question 2: You’re given data about the sales of products within several states within the country. Find the top 3 states where a particular product was sold the most and by what proportion it was sold (% of sales) using an SQL query.
Question 3: Write a program to crash the computer
Interview 4
Type: HR
Questions on your family background, internships, strengths and weaknesses. What have you done to convert those weaknesses to strengths.
Future plans and higher studies.
Why should Oracle hire you?

Application developer profile
TIPS FOR TECH INTERVIEW
Questions will be hard. But they won't expect you to solve it completely. Just show that you are trying and you don't give up easily. Think aloud. If you are asked to write any code, write it legibly and neatly. Don't be rude to the interviewers. The questions they give you might be very vague in the beginning because they expect you to ask doubts and make it clear. Be pleasant and maintain a positive attitude throughout the interview. Prepare a good introduction about yourself. Be thorough with all that you have written in your resume.
Technical Interview 1: (elimination)
Questions regarding projects mentioned in resume.
Tell me a problem which you found challenging. Explain why you found it challenging and it's solution.
           My answer: Maximum sum subarray from an array of positive and negative integers.
He asked me to change the solution when the subarray size is limited to a positive number m.
I was asked to explain the solution with examples.
Tip: explain the solution with great clarity and maintain eye contact.
     3. Given a string. “Today is a rainy day”, print it as follows.
T i  a r d
o s     a a
d        i y
a        n
y        y
4. Why Oracle?
Technical Round 2: (elimination)
He gave a figure with a big triangle and many smaller triangles in it and I was asked to find the number of triangles in it.
Tip: count level by level. 
     2. You are given 6 identical sticks of equal length. How many equilateral triangles can be formed using them?
         Answer 4 (consider 3d space)
    3. Write algorithm for quick sort and explain with examples.
    4. Given an expression, write it's prefix and postfix form.
    5. Write a code to evaluate an infix expression.
    6. What is the use of index in dbms? Mention it's advantages and disadvantages.
Disadvantage : using multiple index files will create insert and update anomalies.
   7. What are triggers? How do you combine triggers defined at insert, delete and update operations?
  8. Given a database with employee names and salary. Salary falls in the range 0 to 50000.
Salary scale is defined as follows.
0-10000 Low
10000 - 20000 Medium
20000  and above High
Write an SQL query to print all employee names and their salary scale.
Tip : Use union operator to combine queries
9.  Write an SQL query to print all employees with equal salary.
Tip : Use group by salary
Technical Round 3: (elimination)
Write a program which covers all the OOP concepts.
Write a cpp/java code which implements a relational database table.
Implement create table, update row, insert row and delete row functions. Everything should be created dynamically. Each column will have many attributes like column name, type, domain etc which is also dynamic.
    3. What is JVM and JRE and how do they differ from each other?
    4. Which is the latest JVM?
    5. Can you dynamically load classes into JVM?
HR Round: 
Tell me about yourself
What are your parents’ expectations about you?
If I go and ask your friends about you, what will be their response?
What are the things your friends want you to improve on?
Why Oracle?
She asked me about my club activities and the works i have done during Ragam and Tathva.
How did the recruitment process go and do you have any suggestion to improve it?
Do you have any question to ask us?
Tips: 
Maintain a good posture while sitting. Show that you are a good team player and quote examples from your real life showing that. Be Frank. Don't use the same strengths and weaknesses copied from internet but be careful that they don't give a negative impression about you. When you mention your weaknesses, state the steps that you are taking to improve them.
Maintain a pleasant smile on your face always.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
AUTHOR : ROHIT SUKUMARAN 
<rohit_b150264cs@nitc.ac.in> 
Hello to all you noobs out there looking to get an idea of what an interview with a company is like. You're probably hoping you can get some insight about the do's and don'ts of any job interview. Well, I cannot guarantee any such knowledge. Nonetheless, I hope you can benefit from my experience. Here is my interview experience with Amazon.
Well first of all, like everyone else, I wrote a screening test which was held online in CCC. And a list of people were shortlisted from the result - about 15 - from which those who were selected for Morgan Stanley didn't attend the interview. Which left around 10 who were actually interviewed. Sitting for the interview involved a lot of waiting for those later in their name list. I remember being called for the interview around 9 am. And then actually being interviewed only at 5.30pm. In the meantime, those who came out after being interviewed were instant celebrities, being extracted of all possible information so that any edge whatsoever could be gained. The common factor you could take out of their experiences is that they gave you a problem and worked with you to come up with a solution. And this was true for me too when my turn finally came.
After I entered and got all the formalities out of the way, the interview began. There were a few sheets of paper and a pencil in front of me. The interviewer scrutinized my resume for quite a while and asked me more or less trivial questions from that. Didn't take more than 10-15 min. After which it got serious. At this point was when our skills were really tested. I was asked two questions regarding simple data structures stacks and queues. And managed to get through them. If I were told to write this article a few months ago I would have been more accurate in saying that the questions I was asked were
1. Implement infix to postfix translation using a stack.
2. Implement a stack using a queue (or the other way round...can't recall)
Now it is important to note that while you are solving the problem, the interviewer may get creative and add more constraints. Such as time and space and others. And more than actually being able to solve the problem, it was more about if they could communicate with me and work with me to find the solution. I was occasionally asked questions about the properties of the algorithm I used and so on. Thus ended the first round.
The second round of interviews took place nearly 2 hours later and Involved a much smaller list of people. The second round followed the exact same pattern. But the questions were much more difficult. And unlike the first round which I aced, I actually needed help finding the solution to these new questions.
The first question I was asked was reversing a linked list without using extra space AND in linear time. Either of one of those constraints and I would have been able to solve it. But with both, my hands were tied. And I was stuck for maybe about 15-20 min. After which the interviewer, who was really cool btw, started helping me out. And as he spoke the solution became clearer and clearer until it was finally implemented. 
The whole of the first question took about an hour to solve. The second question was implementing a post-order tree traversal without recursion. Which was exactly what Murali sir had taught us in class. Unfortunately, I didn't pay much attention in class. However, I remembered just enough to somehow reconstruct the solution. And that was the finale.
So that was that and later that day I found out that I was one of the four who were finally selected for the internship.
If I had to pinpoint what exactly helped me beat the rest I would say my work in the summer vacation really paid off. The summer after the 4th semester I really took to coding on platforms such as hackerrank, codechef, topcoder, hackerearth etc. I worked really hard to code and strengthen my knowledge of the data structures and algorithms. And ultimately that was what was tested. Another less important factor has to be communication. Communication isn't simply about fluent, flamboyant speech. It's about understanding the other person and putting your points across in a way that they can easily understand. I'm drawing a crude comparison here but think of it this way, knowledge is like the noodles in noodle soup, the stuff, the thing that matters. The thing that fills you up. But communication is like the broth that makes the noodles easier to take in. Either one of them by itself would hardly be considered edible by anyone with high standards. And it's the high standards of Amazon that your noodle soup has to satisfy.
I hope this trip along memory lane benefits you, the reader, in any way possible. Good luck with your endeavors and do everything you can to stay competitive.

Amazon came to the campus as a surprise. They were not coming for the past 3-4 years so we were not expecting them to show up. We had two sections for the selection process.
Section 1 - Prelims
We had a set of programming tasks and aptitude questions. After the first round, 16 people were selected. I didn't prepare anything for the prelims but the questions were easy. Before the prelims, they asked us to fill a form on amazon.jobs site. Since we were tired of filling forms for every company from the start of the semester itself, I took it lightly and filled the form carelessly and gave my preferences wrongly. Later, I realized my mistake only when I got shortlisted and saw a printout of my response in their hands. So if you are sitting for Amazon, do take their procedures seriously.
Section 2 - On-site interview
We had 1 day to prepare for Amazon interview after being shortlisted. I had contacted one of our alumni who was working there and had asked for tips. He directed me to refer DSA well. I revised some basic searching, sorting, and trees the previous day and had a nice sleep. Sleeping well helped me a lot the next day and helped me to think analytically before answering. What I've realized is that you are not at all going to cover the entire topics before an interview, so better sleep well and present what all you know properly.
Interview day - So that was the decisive day and Suresh sir asked us to come early. It was my first formal interview but I managed to keep a reasonable amount of composure that day. I knew that there's no point in being tensed, so I took it lightly and spent more time talking to others who are selected and kept the situation calm.
Fortunately, the interview for interns was shifted to afternoon since they had to interview the full-timers first. So we got around 3-4 hours extra and that time ended up being the most crucial factor. I had an error in the resume, which I managed to correct during that extra time I got. So always remember to triple check the resume before going for an interview. Some of us decided to go to SSL and refer previous year questions from Geeksforgeeks. We spent two hours there, and I got one question directly from the Geeksforgeeks question I referred. The interview started at 3 pm.
Round 1 - I got a question regarding the modification of merge sort. I don't remember the exact problem Statement but solved it using two types of insertions. It took around 20 minutes.
Round 2 - I got the same question from Geeksforgeeks but I solved it step by step explaining my thinking process to the interviewer. I solved it in around 30 minutes.
Round 3 - I got a question related to trees. It is described below :
Given a binary search tree, spirally traverse and print the elements in it.
For eg :-
                  5
          4               2
    7       3      11        13
Ans:  5 2 4 7 3 11 13
Solution:
Approach: Think about the property. The traversal is a function of level and direction. Whereas direction is a function of the level itself so essentially it’s a function of level. Think about all the possible traversals that we know, in order, preorder or postorder. We can see that none of them gives us a level function. They all have a child-parent property. So we’ve to somehow exploit the child-parent relationship.
Idea 1: If a parent is in level n then the child is in level n+1. So if we can save these data somewhere according to level then we can traverse.
Idea 2: We just need two data structures since at a certain point we are concerned only about parents and children of level n and level n + 1.
Idea 3: We can use something related to graph traversal to traverse. So we can use a stack or queue to implement it, decided to try out the stack.
Idea 4: Print the parent nodes and push the children nodes to stack. The direction property can be satisfied by alternatively changing the order of pushing left and right.
Idea 5: The shift between stacks should be done only when one stack gets empty
It took around 40 minutes and then I had a good deal of discussion with the interviewer regarding the company and profile offered to us.
After this round, we were allowed to go to hostels and results came that day itself.
I've learned the following things from the process. These are my personal experiences and opinions depend upon perspective.
Our greatest enemy is ourselves, learn to manage tension properly. The interviewer wants the best out of us so they won't try to intimidate us. Moreover clear head and composure help you more than anything else.
Our greatest assets during the interview process are the people who got shortlisted along with us. Motivate them and get motivated by them. Share knowledge, questions, and tips. You are not reducing your chance of getting selected, you are increasing everyone's chance of getting selected. Competition is not the solution, collaboration is. Always remember, the lone wolf dies, the pack survives.
Communication skills are important. I struggled a lot with communicating properly in English.
The interview is not at all about how much you know. It's more about how DEEP you know. They want a master of something not a jack of everything.
Amazon takes the Amazon leadership principles seriously. Read and understand that before going for an interview with Amazon.
Take your time before answering anything. They are patient enough to give you enough time to think. Don't jump into stupid solutions.

I was one of the four from NIT Calicut selected to work as an Intern at Amazon during the summer of 2018. Alongside giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, Amazon is considered to be one of the leading tech companies in the world, and I was extremely grateful to be given an opportunity to work there. 
Amazon’s interview process for interns was purely technical, and consisted of two rounds. All the questions asked were based on DSA. basically the candidates were given a set of problems and expected to come up with the most optimized solution for them. These problems are not very different from the classic DSA interview problems that we see online. The problem solving is expected to be an interactive process, where you present your approach to the interviewer, and listen to his feedback, and gradually arrive at the most optimal solution to the problem. One strategy to tackle the problem would be to first provide the ‘brute-force’ approach, and then gradually work on it by introducing Data Structures and Algorithms to optimise the solution. 
It is not expected of you to know the solution of the question when it is asked, they are more interested in seeing your problem solving process, and expect you to arrive at the required solution during the interview. Hence, it is vital to make the interview process as interactive as possible. The interviewer will usually help you by indicating whether you are going in the right direction, and may even give you a hint if you are stuck somewhere. Once you have developed your solution, you are expected to write it down on paper in a language of your choice. 
The reason the interview was so focused on DSA was mainly due to the fact that it took place in the beginning of S5, and DSA was the only ‘core’ CSE topic that we were familiar with. You can also expect questions from topics like Compilers, Networks, DBMS, OS etc, but DSA is generally the area focused on. 
While preparing for the interview, The first step is to be thorough with all the major Data Structures and Algorithms present in C.L.R.S(Introduction to Algorithms). It is also essential that you completely understand the concept of time complexity, and are able to estimate the complexity of any given algorithm. Once you have a grasp on the fundamentals, you can proceed to prepare for the actual interview questions. Some websites that I have found to contain a good set of questions are GeeksForGeeks.com and InterviewBit.com. I also referred to a book called “Cracking the Coding Interview”, which turned out to be very useful.

Rounds - 2 technical and 1 HR
First round was like a rapid fire round with 2 interviewers who were quite hostile and not very supportive. They were focused more on the basics and also asked me to code something based on string manipulation. They were shooting questions at me even before I could answer the previous ones. Please remember to stay calm and composed in situations like these. They also went through my resume and asked about the projects I worked on. 
The second technical round was a much more relaxed round with a very supportive interviewer and he asked me to design a system for handling a data storage problem( I think ) and asked me to suggest a suitable design pattern for its implementation. Unfortunately I don't remember the exact scenario that he wanted me to solve. Make sure you familiarise yourself with all the software design patterns and have practical examples of which to use when. 
The last round was a HR round which was more of a friendly conversation discussing about my future plans and whether or not I am interested in higher studies, how a career would progress at SAP etc.
Basics about DBMS was asked quite a lot to my friends so that would be a good place to start preparing for SAP. Please try to get a good understanding of atleast one of the programming languages, because you will be asked about it. There are a lot of coding problems which are very frequently asked and are available on sites like GeeksForGeeks which I found extremely helpful. Please utilise these resources to the maximum and I assure you these will help somewhere along the placement procedure. Interviews can seem very challenging at first. If you do get your first interview right well and good. If not, please don't lose hope. Never aim for just one company and lose all hope when you don't succeed in getting through in that. There is a plethora of companies that visit our campus and most of them have great packages too. Arm yourself with confidence and a desire to succeed when facing interviews and never shy out or keep tight-lipped. Show your interest to the recruiters and present your best self ALWAYS. Of course technical knowledge is essential but at the end of the day it may not be just your technical skills that get you through.

SAP Labs India came to our campus to recruit both full timers and interns in August. There was an online test which tested our knowledge in Java, OOPS, DBMS and some basics in addition to some aptitude questions too. Ten people from both MCA and B.Tech were selected. 
We had three rounds - two Technical and one HR round.
It was a purely technical round. I was asked about the computer languages I was comfortable with and was asked to write down all the subjects we were taught till then. I was even asked if I had done any projects previously. Questions were asked on the basics in C language – Structures, Pointers, Dynamic Memory Allocation etc. Besides this, I was asked to:
1. Write a program in C which showing the implementation of Polymorphism.
2. Implementation of Circular Linked List
3. Construct a Binary Search Tree of level 4 and do all the traversals on it – Preorder, Inorder , Post order
4. A program to remove duplicates in an array. (I was asked to give an optimal solution for the solutions I had presented).
There were two code snippets given to me and I was asked to explain what each line did or rather what was happening. I had to say whether that code would give an output or not. If there was an error in the code, I had to point out the error, explain what would have happened because of that error and correct that error. There was a question on Enum and Vectors in C++.
It was a mixed round and not a purely technical one. It was mostly based on logical thinking and problem solving. Initially I was asked to introduce myself and then was asked to write a program to print the minimum number of notes required to get a required(given) amount when there are notes of certain denomination. (Greedy approach).
1. The Burning Candles question – with both uniform and non-uniform burning rates.
2. Given ‘n’ players and that each match has two players against each other, how many matches will be required to determine the winner?
3. Implement two stacks using one array.
After the technical part, I was asked about the sports that I had played and the sports or games I was interested in.
This was an HR round. I was asked to introduce myself and tell about my interests.
Some questions I remember:
1. Why did you choose Engineering?
2. Why CSE and why NIT Calicut?
3. Why do you want to do internship in our company?
4. Who is your role model?
5. If given a choice between sports and studies, what would you choose?
6. Do you have any plans of further studies?
7. What is your opinion about this interview?
I was even asked about my hobbies and how they were of benefit to me.
After all the rounds, I was asked to fill up a form and was asked to wait till the results were announced.
1. Be very strong and thorough with the basics of topics you have knowledge about. Be confident in Data Structures and Algorithms.
2. Make sure you listen to the question completely and clarify every doubt you have with the interviewer before proceeding towards the solution.
3. It is better to have some relevant questions that you can ask the interviewer before leaving the room.
4. Do not get tensed up if do not know the answer. Try to remain calm. Be truthful.
Wish you all the very best!

The selection procedure was as follow:
     It contained basic mathematical questions related to permutations, probability and basic questions of DSA (stack, queue). There were lot of questions related to OOP concept in form of code snippet, multiple choice questions and true/false statement. There few basic questions related to JAVA SCRIPT.
    The interview was online. It was a 45 minutes interview. It was a one to one interview. He asked me a lot of questions from OOP concept there also. Since the company came after completion of 5th semester, I was asked to explain about OS concept about virtual machines, memory allocation. A few questions related to DBMS like normalization were also asked. He checked my resume and asked about my ongoing projects. He asked me about in very detailed manner. He asked about various classes used in my project. 
The more important thing about interviews are be confident and don’t answer to any question which you don’t know. Don’t start guessing in interviews. There were times in my interview where I took my time explained how to do the things rather than the theories of the question asked. Be calm there. The interviewer was very friendly and calm. Also please find good questions to ask to interviewers.

Online test was purely coding round on hacker rank. There were 3 rounds in the interview. First round was pure technical. Asked mainly from DSA and algorithms. But also a few questions from DBMS OS and all. Second round was slightly different. He asked a few puzzles. Also some general questions like why do you want to join Tesco and all. There was also a high level design question. Number of people taken - 4 Tips: 
Be thorough with the fundamentals. Rather than by hearting stuff, understand what exactly is going on and why. 
Be enthusiastic. They should feel that you genuinely want to join the company. 
Do a bit of research about the company. Be ready to answer questions like why you want to join, etc 
If you do not know the answer to some questions tell it honestly, rather than trying to guess. Some people had a HR round. For me basically he just said that they're offering me the job.

AUTHOR : SUDHI MOHAN 
Company: Visual IQ (Infopark, Kochi)
Stipend offered: 20k per month
Duration: 2 months, from May to June.
No. of interns selected: 5
It was the 14th of February when Visual IQ came to our college for hiring interns. I had never heard of this company before. Amused by their name, I straightaway decided to research about them. That being said, here goes your first takeaway point. Always do your research about the company before attending the hiring process. I’ll tell you why soon enough.
They kept a CGPA cut-off of 6.5 and requested only 3rd year CSE students to participate in the process.
The applicants were invited to Aryabhatta Hall for a presentation of the company. The PPT was very informative, and I was honestly impressed by their work and accomplishments. At the end of the slideshow, we were asked if we have any questions for the team. To their horror, none of us raised any questions. Now this is a serious problem. At the end of any presentation, make sure you have a set of questions prepared to ask the recruiters. It gives an awful impression about the college if none of the students ask any questions to the employers. It either means you aren't interested in the company or you are terrible at communicating with humans. This is one of the reasons why I asked to you to ‘research’ earlier. If you have prepared, then go ahead and shoot it out. If you are a shy person by nature, just don't wait for that alpha male/female in the class. You won't grow as a person if you keep mum in situations like these. Get out of your comfort zone!
We had our first round, a written test, right after the presentation. The questions were MCQs, and we were handed OMR sheets to mark our responses, just like good old days (Phew :P). There were two parts, Technical and Aptitude. In the technical part, we were asked questions based on fundamental CS concepts, like programming, DBMS, etc.
Examples:
1. Print the output of the program.
     int main()
     {
     printf("Hey");
     break;
     } 
     Ans: Compilation error.
2. What would be the output of the program if we followed static scoping and dynamic scoping, respectively?
In the aptitude part, we were asked passage-based questions which dealt with Set Theory, Permutations & Combinations, etc. In our answer sheets, we were also required to mention our skill set and technologies we would like to work with.
After the first round, around 25-30 of us progressed to the next round, which was a Group Discussion. We were divided into three groups and given the following topics-
Can human inventions kill themselves?
AI: A boon or a bane?
The Goal of Education is Employment - Comment.
Let's face it, all of us are not the same. Some of us are very confident at speaking, some are the exact opposite. But we all do need the internship, don't we? I usually would not take the initiative to do something unless it is a life-threatening situation. So fear not, for there is a way out for everyone.
When you get the topic, brainstorm and jot down all the points that come to your head on a paper. Prepare a paragraph in your head that would encompass all these things. Wait for the right moment to speak. You could either start off or come forth as an argument to someone else's view. Or you could share it as a standalone view on the topic. When you speak, make sure you speak with confidence and complete whatever you wanted to say. If someone cuts you off, you could politely ask them to wait for you to finish. While not speaking, listen attentively to what everyone is saying. You do not want to repeat the same thing another person has already said. Sometimes vital points come to your head when you hear your colleagues speak. So watch out.
After the GD, they shortlisted around 10 people for the interviews. This is was my second interview, and I was not that tensed compared to the first time. I was greeted by two Visual IQ employees, and they offered me a seat. They asked me to introduce myself, and I did.
They asked me just one question - to explain the object-oriented programming paradigm in detail with the help of an example(class diagram and stuff). I was actually not that confident at OOPS and didn't answer the question as I would have liked to. They didn’t look convinced by my answer and I thought I lost it right there. After that, they decided to wind up the session, and finally asked me the cliche question, “Why should we hire you at Visual IQ?”. And that concluded my interview.
They took 5 of us in the end.
If you feel like this post hasn’t been worthwhile, let me try to make it a bit more useful by adding some preparation tips:
Do company-specific preparation, especially for the prelims. This is where you’ll have the edge among your competitors. Look up the company in the GeeksForGeeks archives, or any other website and understand the type of questions they ask and prepare accordingly.
There is only one way to glory. Practice. If you feel like you are not that good at coding, then get out there and start coding! Simply reading the solution to problems will not do. Those CodeChef Long Challenges help a lot. Trust me.
Never underestimate the significance of HR rounds/questions. I know many people who lost their opportunities because they messed up in that area. Prepare answers to questions like
Why should we hire you?
Why do you want to join this company?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
Introduce yourselves.
Never lose the determination in you. You may stumble a lot of times. Make sure you learn from your mistakes and improve the next time around.
This is all that I have to share with you. If you have any queries or doubts, feel free to ping me. I would be glad to answer them.
Hope this diary log has helped you.

The company offers a stipend of 20k per month and the place of the internship is Kochi. 
There was no CGPA cut off. 
First, there was a PPT followed by an offline test (Pen-Paper) held in aryabhatta hall. Make sure you read well about the company and ask questions during the PPT. The questions for the first round mainly were logic and math questions. C output questions and a few SQL and DBMS questions were also asked. The questions were not very difficult. 
The next round was a GD round. 24 students were shortlisted and were divided into groups of 3. The topic my panel got was something like “Can human inventions kill themselves?". About 12 students were shortlisted after the GD round.
Next round was an interview. There were two interviewers. It was more like a discussion compared to the other interviews I had attended. They mainly asked about my interests and about the projects I had done. Be prepared to answer questions on your project. You are expected to know the things you have written in your resume. There were questions like why Visual IQ? Make sure you are prepared for questions like these. There was only one round of interview. In the end, they selected 5 of us.

Screening Test
Combination of MCQ’s and a coding question. MCQ’s were mainly based on aptitude.
Coding Question
Given an amount. Buy maximun number of textbooks with that amount.Price and number of textbooks from each shop is different.
Input :      50
                  2
                 20
                 24
                  2
                 20
                 24 
Output :   48
Explanation : We have 50 rs in hand. The number of textbooks in respective bundles are 20 and 24. Their prices are 20 and 24. We can buy two 24 bundles with 48 rs.Therefore total number of textbooks is 48.
Interview Round 1(Technical Round):
Questions on complexity were asked. A sample problem was given and it’s time and space complexity were to be found out.
Project was discussed in detail.
Algorithm for fibonacci and bubble sort were asked. Detailed explanation of the algorithm and the results after each step were asked. Given an input and asked to dry run.
Asked about my favourite subjects. Mine were OS and DSA. They had planned to ask hard DBMS questions in case that was my strong area. There were no OS experts present.
Height and depth of binary trees.
Complexity of all sorting algorithms.
Asked about certain OOPs concepts like inheritance.
Went through resume thoroughly
Asked about difficulties faced during project and how i overcame it.
Interview Round 2(HR):
Introduce yourself
Hobbies
Took one of my projects and asked me if i could do it using better technology if i had more time
Interviewer seemed interested in my positions of responsibility 
Gave situations to test if i was a team player
Enquired about future plans like higher studies
You have studied in this institution for 4 years. How can you apply what you learned from here to real life.
What innovative idea would you like to implement in Target
Finally he asked me to ask him a set of questions.
Mine was the first interview to get over so i had a two member panel for technical round. The other candidates only had one interviewer. Since the Job Description included details on what they were looking for in a candidate it was easy to impress them. They needed people who had a general idea on DSA topics and the ones who had done projects. They were also looking for people who had the passion to learn new technology and many questions were asked to clarify if we were willing to keep learning even if we were occupied with our work.

1. CGPA cutoff :  7.5
2. Online coding test  : Don’t Remember Much
3. Number of rounds in the interview : 2 Rounds of interview. No HR round
4. Sample questions in each round : 
They asked Logical questions and Network related technical questions. They also asked questions based in low level C (Bit manipulations)
They asked about questions whose logic lies in Bit level manipulation which involves XORs, shift operations and bit wise operations.
eg:
How to cut a cake in 8 pieces with 3 cuts?
    Ans) Cut vertical and horizontal (Form 4 quarters). Then 1 bisecting  the height of the cake parallel to the base, making 8 pieces.
How to cut a circle into 8 pieces with 3 cuts?
    Ans) Here we obviously can’t cut with the method above. Cut vertical and horizontal (Form 4 quarters) as before. Now cut in the             shape of the circle itself passing through each quarter, thus making it in to 8 pieces.
When does 1 + 1 become 1 itself?
    Ans) 2 rivers join and become a big river (1+1=1). 2 drops of water coalesce  in to 1 drop. Etc
There is a round table that can spin on top. There are 4 glasses placed upside down. You are blindfolded. With minimal moves make the configuration of the glasses same and Upright, given that after each move the table may or may not be spun?
    Ans) This is a tricky question (bit difficult). You can find the answer in Wikipedia. Its apparently a very well-known question.
What will you do if you are asked to create a racing car team or a football team?
    Ans) This is a question that tests our mindset (so he told, after I told the answer). There is no exact answer I think, but what I said           was “I don’t have any real experience with making cars. I Will hire the best people in the world, who have the experience and                   knowledge”, he was happy with that and stopped me from going on.
They asked about basic network stuffs like protocols. They asked in detail about routing protocols like BGP, ISIS. They asked what algorithm (Dijkstra/ Bellman-ford) these protocols used.
5. Position and stipend :
Networking Software Engineer. 13.5LPA CTC
6. Preparation tips, if any:
In general:
Coding:
Study geeks for geeks. They have a lot of questions for each specific company. Very often they ask they same questions. Study the questions for that company before hand. Revise the day before the test.
There is no replacement for practice. Practice on Codechef, hackerearth, hackerrank etc. 
Interview:
Read Books: 
CRACKING the CODING INTERVIEW is a good book for learning how to handle interviews.
Data Structures and Algorithms, made easy  by Narasimha Karumanchi is an awesome book and I know for a fact that a lot of my friends have benefited from it. I strongly recommend this to get your data structures straight.
Be prepared to handle rejections. Be prepared to handle some bad interviews. An interview with a company is not going to be the same as another. If you get rejected it does not mean you are bad at things, it might just mean that you are having a bad day (An interviewer told me this).
Mingle with candidates who went to the interview room before you. You’ll be amazed how many questions repeat. Sometimes across panels. This has helped me a lot.
This is a personal note, this may not be the case always. Be confident. If you know something then amaze them with your level of knowledge on that front. If you don’t know something, then say it upfront. Its better than they finding that you don’t know something after you ask them to explain the question and get in to the nitty gritty details. This saves you time to move on to some other topic that you know well. Otherwise its less no of questions that you get to answer.
I have read in a book that If you have heard of the question before, then say that you’ve heard it before and then answer. The book said that it will increase the trust of the interviewer in you. I don’t believe this. I have done this, and I think the interviewer simply ignored that question. My suggestion is, play it cool and stumble and few times before you give the answer (Yeah!). Don’t say that you have heard the question before.
Don’t be hesitant to ask them questions. Clarify every detail of the question before answering it. They like this. At the end of the interview they’ll ask if you have any questions. Be prepared for this, ask a different question each time. This will show that you are indeed interested in the company and want to work there. Or simply it’ll mean more time you talk with the interviewer and this can sometimes get you through cut off levels.
Study well about the company before hand. Sometimes its good that you answer some questions during the presentation (you’ll get goodies). Otherwise it’ll give you chance to ask meaningful questions to them at the end of each round.
Always think out loud. Make sure the interviewer knows your each line of thought. Even if its wrong, sometimes they’ll help you and give you directions. This is something they look for in a candidate, so that they can get a read on you. This is important. Write what you think in a paper, draw diagrams with arrows and stuff. List out the points. Write the code in the paper. Practise doing this.
The panels matter a lot. Sometimes you’ll get a good panel, sometimes you don’t. Its simply luck, you can’t do anything about that. But be prepared for this. Make sure that you don’t get disheartened with the loss of a few interviews. Give them your best shot each time. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.
Keep an open mind. Never say out loud that you don’t like to work as a test engineer or you don’t like to do this and that. They want people who can adjust towards and adapt a lot of options, keep that in mind.
Specific To Sandvine:
Coding: Don’t remember.
Interview:
Be very confident. Play it cool. Between the rounds talk to the people around. About the panels, questions asked, people to look out for.
My first round of interview was with the person who gave the presentation. He was very confident. I made sure he knew that I was energetic and excited for the interview. He cracked a few joke in between, we laughed. He asked a few individual specific question to me, I was interested in Design and UI, so when he asked about something UI related, I steered the interview towards my domain and we got deep in to it. He asked me list things that I think are important in UI, I did it and explained each of them. He was impressed. He asked me the Racing Car question. He liked my answer, he told me that’s what he was looking for.
My second round has 2 people interviewing me. Usually this happens for stress rounds. I got ready for that. Keep Calm, that’s what you keep in mind in a stress round. But fortunately my first interviewer was one of the interviewer. It was alright. I knew a some questions. Few questions, I barely got through. But since I was explaining my each approach, the interviewers helped me solve a few questions. He asked me a few logical questions whose answered I had already noted during my talks with other candidates. It was a cake walk from there on.
Personal Note:
This was the fourth company I was sitting for. I had a few good interviews and I had a few downright awful ones. In each interview I learned something new and I made it a point not to repeat my mistakes. You’ll sometimes know what went wrong in an interview, better that next time. But sometimes you won’t know what went wrong. Believe me, its difficult handle that, but understand that there is a bit of luck factor involved (no joke), and you just had a bad day.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
AUTHOR : VATSALA JHA
Online round:
The initial round was an online screening round which had 3 sections of MCQs.
The first section was based on Quantative Aptitude and Logical reasoning.
The next section was consisted MCQs based on CS subjects(majorly DSA, OS, OOPS, etc)
The final section consisted of 4 coding questions in which you were expected to write the pseudocodes only. The  questions were based on strings, binary trees etc and were pretty basic.
The key was managing and attempting all the questions as it was a fairly simple test overall compared to some other tests.
12 people were shortlisted and there 2 technical rounds followed.
1st Round:
The first round was a  one-on-one interview and the interviewer was a friendly person. He began with asking me to introduce myself. After asking a couple of questions based on the intro, he moved on to the pseudocodes I had written in my online round. He pointed out errors in one of my codes and asked me to write an efficient solution for another one. After discussing the code I had written he moved on to my resume. Questions on the projects I had done followed. He wanted to make sure that i was thorough with those and the dicussion on the resume lasted for a good 15 minutes after which he began asking questions on networks. I could only answer his first question and i mentioned that we had not yet had a course on networks. That was all in the first round.
It could be a bonus to know a bit of networks as Sandvine is a networking company.
2nd Round:
The second round lasted for over 30 minutes and there were 3 people in my interview panel. The interview began with questions on the projects in my resume, after which he asked me to list out all the subjects  from 1st through 4th sem. Then he touched upon all the subjects of 3rd and 4th sem and asked me questions on those. He also aksed me to name the topics of all the math courses in the 4 semesters which was quite a struggle :p. A lot of the initial questions were based on architechture(32-bit machine, 64-machine, memory, things that the compiler, language or achitechture decides etc). They weren’t friendly and in fact were trying to be intimidating.  Next questions on basic data structures followed. Implementing a stack using queues, circular queues, detecting loop in a linked list etc. He asked me about OOPS but as I said I didn’t know the concept very well so he skipped that. Next up he showed 4-5 code snipppets in C and asked for the output. These were based on variable types, storage, scope etc(static, extern etc). Finally he asked me to solve the 3x3 magic square and asked the logic behind it. He was insistent that I clearly write down most anwers and preferred those to verbal explanations.
Finally the results were announced and 2 people were selected. They bascially made sure that we knew our resume properly and also the basics of the courses learnt in the second year and OS.

Online round: 
The initial round was an online screening round which had 2 sections. 
The first section consisted of MCQ's based on DSA , Oops etc. There was no preview for this section (ie., Once you move to next question you can’t come back).Around 25- 30 questions were there which we had to do in 35 minutes. 
Then the second section was of aptitude, logical reasoning , idioms and phrases and some basic English. This had 30 questions in 30 minminutesminminutesutesminminutesminminutesutesutesutes. Time management was the key. 
Questions were basic and simple. One should be fast enough. 
14 people were shortlisted to next round. 
Offline round : 
There was only one round(tech+ hr).This round lasted for about 15-20 minutes. Two people were there ( one tech person and other HR person). They were friendly. Firstly, 
it started off with introduce yourself and stuff. Later they asked about my electives. As one of my electives was DAA, they asked me to explain dynamic programming (as in how it works), divide and conquer and asked me to list out all the topics that were covered in that course. And then they asked my current favourite subject and I said it was Pattern Recognition. They asked me to list out all the topics and asked few questions regarding the same. They asked if I knew how to use Anaconda/Jupyter and if I use them on server or online account ( azure or Amazon).They also asked about my parents. They asked me what I wanted to do in next five years and wanted to know where I saw myself in five years. They also asked about my inspiration and role model. 
Finally the results were out and 4 people got selected.

Reliance Industries (not Jio!) was one of the last companies to to visit us for internships. Internship offer was for two months in Navi Mumbai with a stipend of Rs 30,000 pm. They had a CGPA cutoff of 6 (upto S5) and around 60 students were shortlisted. 
The preliminary round consists of an online test consisting of 30 technical and aptitude questions each. There was no coding questions! The test was on Aspiringminds platform(AMCAT). Questions have to solved in an order which was a challenge since you will get only one look at the question before you move on to the next. The technical questions were simple and were mainly from basic DSA, DBMS and OOP concepts. There were output prediction questions with C like syntax. The aptitude questions were little difficult and everyone found it hard to complete in 30 minutes. 14 students where shortlisted for interviews and they selected 4.
Interview was short and had a single 2 v 1 Technical + HR round. Interviewer started off with asking my favourite subject and then went with questions from that area. They’ll thoroughly examine your resume and ask questions from it. Make sure you know what you gave in the resume! (this is very important).
Questions asked:(I said networks as my favourite subject)
What is router?
How does a router route packets?
Difference between TCP and UDP.
What is a software defined network?
What is cloud computing?
Types of cloud services.
Some questions from my resume.
HR was busy with something else and didn’t ask any questions :|
There was a form which we had to fill before you go inside the interview room. You can expect questions from that as well. The form had potential for a lot of HR questions.
    Be confident and composed throughout the interview. Before jumping into conclusions, ask precise questions to the interviewers and understand the context clearly. If you don’t know or you don’t remember something, tell that to them straight away*(Not always). Make sure you interact with them well starting from the presentation. Don’t hesitate to ask questions whenever you get an opportunity. 
*Some interviewers expects you to attempt the questions (coding questions, design questions, puzzles etc) and they will be willing to work with you if you are having trouble solving it. Don’t immediately avoid the question and instead work with interviewer.
Some general Tips: (In no particular order)
Have a well-written, concise, precise resume with a good template(not too fancy) and make sure it does not exceed two pages. Note that your resume sets the first impression.
Communication skills are crucial. Make sure you are able to convey your ideas clearly.
Practice writing code!! You will never have the comfort of your favourite text editor/ IDE inside the interview room.
Learn JAVA, Python and Git - generally companies don’t expect much about technologies from internship candidates but if they do, these are the most sought after.
Keep your resume up-to-date. Always update your resume for each companies based on their area of interest and job profile.
Honesty is the best policy.
TnP is hard, get used to it! Be aware of all the deadlines.
Do a proper research about the company before applying. Ask seniors who is working/ interned before/ attended interview before and gain as much knowledge as possible. Often you will only get few hours for this before the deadline, so go through the interview diaries and read about all companies visited before.
Competitive coding is the way to go! Do lots of coding in your free time and be aware of all the common questions asked by companies. Check geeksforgeeks for this.
Make yourself standout, ppts are the best place to start. Don’t hesitate to ask questions.
Don’t forget smile during the interview. 
Take everything above with a pinch of salt.

Qualcomm's interview wasn't a very rigorous one but they were quite certain about the type of the intern that they wanted. The interview consisted of 2 rounds - 1 technical and 1 HR. Initially there were 4 candidates from CSE, of which 3 qualified to the second round. Finally 2 of us were able to get in.
My interviewer for the technical round was quite chill. He made me feel quite comfortable by asking me to introduce myself, my hobbies etc. He then proceeded to questioning me on my resume. It is very important that you know whatever is written on your resume. Then, he asked me which was my favourite course and asked me to explain a portion of the course that had fascinated me the most. I explained about virtual memory. He asked me few questions on it. I was able to answer all of it except one. It is fine to tell the interviewer that you don't know answers to some questions rather than making it up. But don't give up easily. Think out loud.  Some interviewers will guide your thinking process. Some of my fellow candidates were asked a lot of logical questions and puzzles.
The HR round barely took three minutes. He had a rude tone throughout. He asked me general questions and asked about where I preferred to have my posting. I told I preferred Bangalore, and I added that it was not the location but an internship at Qualcomm that I valued the most. He asked about my interested field to work on. Ensure that your answer to this question is something from the job description of the company.
It's important to keep a cool head throughout any interview process. You will be marked on your attitude, your confidence and your knowledge level. It is also important that you don't get disheartened when you lose an opportunity. Believe that the best is always on its way.

CS/EC/EE 
Philips visited the campus during the last week of September. Their requirement was for people with a basic level of technical and managerial skills. Their process was focussed on that only. Compared to the companies that have visited before, their procedure was relatively easy. Roughly 57 students were registered for the process. 
There were four rounds: Online test, Technical, Managerial and HR 
Around 45 MCQs and one coding question. It roughly covered topics from aptitude and technical streams. Around 30 students were shortlisted for the personal interview. 
The questions were from topics like Data Structures, Operating Systems, and Database. The difficulty level was easy. They were looking for those who had basic knowledge in those subjects. You will be instructed to write some sample codes for certain problems. Most of the students were eliminated after this round. 
They gave more preference to this round than Technical. They were looking for people who could handle multiple positions and extracurricular activities were a plus. The questions were targetted to evaluate your managerial potential. There were eliminations after this round, too. 
This round was more of a formality. As you might’ve read in any of the other interview experiences, staying cool and answering their queries will help you to clear this round. 
The key is to create an attractive resume and stick to whatever you have mentioned. Along with the projects and your academic performance, they do consider your extra-curricular activities. Also, be attentive to the pre-placement talk. Showing interest in their work will help to create an impression. 
At the end of the day, they selected 5, four B.techs and one Mtech.

1. Cgpa cutoff was 7 i guess 
2. Coding test was the first round Which was simple actually.
There was 2 questions, first of which was very simple and second was a little bit tougher than first.
The topics were the common topics that we find on online coding platforms and practices (like manipulation of arrays,linked lists,pointers,stack,queue and their applications etc)
3. There were 3 rounds in interview-2 technical and 1 HR 
4. The first round was easy. Questions was from the usual common questions from complexity of algorithms, popular algorithms and their complexities,properties of data structures, some simple sql queries and concepts related to OS like paging,thrashing,memory structures,etc..(mainly it was ds and algo).
Second round was like solving a real world scenario or practical situation ,with the knowledge we have(databases,data structures,os concepts,etc..) mine was to design a database subject to some constraints and something related to tries , they are trying to analyze how we solve real problems 
Third round was HR , we can expect usual questions like why this company, where do you see yourself after 5 years, Hobbies,role models,etc 
5. Position: Software engineering associate 
    Stipend: it is 8.5 lpa 
6. For cracking first rounds of all interviews : practice in online coding platforms , preferably hackerrank and geeksforgeeks 
For interviews: best books to refer are the 2 written by Narasimha Karumanji(don’t remember the titles, one was theory explained and the other is previously asked questions) 
For aptitude tests: indiabix.com (it’s simple but it helps us to get in touch with all the topics in the area) 
For HR round : Karumanji books contain this too The main thing we need to refer from or prepare is the 2 books by Narasimha karumanji It’s available in internet also, as pdf I think it is not getting the importance it actually have when we prepare and later we realise that it was very much important 
7. They took 5 people 4 UG and 1 PG, 2 CSE and 3 ECE people.

Bangalore/ Hyderabad/ Noida
First round all questions from CV, so this may vary for you. Since I had written about being web admin, they asked about what work exactly that entails, and how the ‘s’ in ‘https’ works. Basically to see if your cv is truthful. I admitted that I wasn’t sure on the exact specifics, so I felt like the first round went badly. Then since I had ‘REST api’, a couple questions about that, http methods, etc. 
The coding question was to write a pattern matching algo for username and password with some constraints, in any language with correct syntax (I wrote it in C). I mentioned that I would refactor it later into separate functions, but I wrote it in a bit messy way, while explaining my steps out loud. I’m very sure there were syntax errors, but she didn’t look at my code in depth since I explained while writing it.
Then she asked me to make a state diagram for that (thankfully I remembered from TOC/SE), explain some the common regex expressions were (*,.,+), what would be a ‘greedy’ parser. I could answer these since I had taken compiler lab.
Then to write 10 tests that validates the code. I found 3 cases that my code would not pass, and mentioned how I can fix them. 
Some OS questions about static vs dynamic linking/memory management/page fault. About linux command like ps and ‘nice’ness of a process. Then the usual ‘ask the interviewer’ questions (keep them prepared based on the company).
I doubt this will work for every interviewer, but at the end of the session I asked if I could talk about a certain project that I personally was proud of (that she didn’t ask me about). They may have liked that, because otherwise I felt I wouldn’t get past the first round.
(The second round is sometimes DSA, sometimes OS/etc)
This round was different for everyone, even when we had the same interviewer. I got a classic question, given n people’s schedules, find an interval where everyone is free. (Which we learnt in DAA)I solved it in a different way, even when he gave me hints like try using a sorting function. He asked me what my favorite sorting function was.
Then was a simple logical puzzle, people of different seeds crossing a bridge, which he asked to a previous candidate. I told him I’ve heard of it, but he said it’s fine, still try. I still got the wrong answer, but he said he wanted to give at least one question that I would get wrong.
A simple BST traversal question, somethings about min-heap, and what was my favorite data structure, and why. About insertion/insertion in an ordered manner/ what would be better than that data structure? Since I said hashmap, I had to explain about that.
This round went well, totally depend on the questions you get vs what you studied. Most of it’s luck at this point.
Was supposed to be technical, but since they ran out of time , it was a 5 min HR talk, about my internship/Strength/weakness/why Oracle/ If you were the only one we could hire, why should we choose you?/ maybe something about other companies you tried (don’t answer these fully!)
Finally around 11:00 pm they announced the final list, almost all passed the HR Round.

APPLICATIONS ENGINEER
AUTHOR : SAAHIL KUNNATH
So I got placed at Oracle as an Applications Engineer. As usual the process started with an aptitude test which had around 100 questions on varying topics such as maths, programming, reasoning, gates etc. Based on the scores of this test we were shortlisted for the interviews. I went through 3 technical rounds and an HR round.
This was a simple round since I already knew the answers to questions like "What's your name?" and "What are your interests?". I was then asked the water-jug problem which was easy as well and one sql query question. 
This was a long round which went on for more than an hour . Question was to code a program to solve sudoku(9x9). I coded the
simple backtracking solution within half an hour (pseudo-code) . Logic is important here but some smaller things that people often ignore are 
a) Modularity 
b) Code that is easily readable and understandable. 
Modularity means breaking down your program into smaller parts that perform specific tasks. So start off with a big function and then make helper functions that are called from within this function and so on. Often times this is very helpful since if you get stuck somewhere while writing the code you can just call a function over there and continue worrying the remaining code. Once done you can work on the part you were stuck on by making it a seperate helper function.
Make sure you name these functions in a way that anyone reading the code can understand their purpose. Indent your code properly and give  meaningful names to your variables. Also as Paleri sir says "the design should be precise" so spend some time thinking before you jump into writing code. 
I was asked the time and space complexity of my solution. After this I was told to improve my code and was given another 20 minutes or so. I made some minor improvement but couldn't think of any major changes. 
The interviewer then asked if I we should end the interview or he should give me another question. I asked for another question, obviously. He then have the 12 horse puzzle which took me half an hour to solve and the interviewer was satisfied.
This round was the manager round. He asked me about myself and how I would be a good fit for the company. He also asked me about my higher study plans to which I'm guessing everyone knows the answer by now. I was given one coding question which I don't remeber, but it was an easy ad-hoc kinda question.
This was the HR round. It was basically a pretty chill conversation that started with "Tell me about yourself" and went on for 15 minutes around. They just want to check if you'll be a good fit for the company culturally, that's it. 
That's it about the rounds. Last thing I'd say is don't ever give up during the interviews . Perseverance is the key. Make sure your DSA, DBMS and Software Engineering knowledge is sound. I wasn't asked any questions on networks or OS or compilers but it doesn't hurt to be knowledgeable about them as well. Know your projects well. And last but not the least, don't take yourself too seriously.

No Backlog
Branch: CSE (B.Tech + M.Tech) , EEE (B.Tech + M.Tech) & ECE (B.Tech + M.Tech)
There were a total of 4 rounds ( 1 qualification round + 2 technical interviews + 1 HR interview). 
What to expect in this round?
The online round was conducted on their own platform. It had various sections like:-
Verbal Ability (passage reading, grammar)
General Aptitude (logical, maths)
Technical Assessment (DBMS, OS)
Coding Assessment (output questions for AVL, Trees, Graphs)
Flow Chart Problems 
Difficulty: Easy-Medium
    The test duration is 2 hours so time management is very crucial.
How to prepare?
No specific preparation is required to clear this round. One can use https://prepinsta.com/oracle/ to practice the questions asked in the past. This website has invaluable resources for placement / internship preparation for many companies.
    
Nearly 100 students were shortlisted for the next round.
What to expect in this round?
The interviewer would check your problem solving skills and your confidence in the solutions that you provide for the asked questions.
Questions I was asked:
Coding question (pen & paper):
Determine the angle between minute & hour hand given a time in hh: mm am/pm format.
Frog jumping: A frog can jump across a pond using `n` stones lying in the pond. It can either jump over 1 stone or 2 stones at a time. Determine the number of ways the frog can cross the pond. (Hint: fibonacci, dp)
Given two numbers `a` and `b`, determine the number of bits in the binary representation of `a` required to convert it to `b` with best possible time complexity. (Hint: XOR)
DBMS:-
Criteria for choosing a primary key, candidate key, closure of attributes
Fundamentals like NULL value equivalence across rows & column
Case insensitive SQL queries
Difficulty: Medium
How to prepare?
Go through the previously asked questions on GeeksForGeeks. The coding related questions were  based on well-known dp problems. For preparing DBMS, one can use Sanchit Jain’s tutorial on YouTube -- the videos are short and to the point.
What to expect in this round?
Compared to the 1st round, this round had lesser but slightly advanced problems. They test how deeply you understand a given concept.
Questions I was asked:
OOPs concepts:
Encapsulation 
Polymorphism, types of polymorphism
Real world example of the above concepts
I was asked my favorite data structure. I answered self-balancing trees. Questions that followed were-
Inorder, Preorder, Postorder traversals
Insertion in BST and explanation of worst case complexity of it
How can the linear time complexity of insertion (in worst-case) be improved?
Answer: By using AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree
Explain any one of AVL or Red-Black Tree.
I picked AVL, questions that followed:
Create a balanced BST (AVL tree) given some input showing each step.
Explain the rotations, RR, LL, RL & LR
Explain the balance factor {-1,0,1}
Write a recursive function
Iterative Vs Recursive functions - Differences
Pros and Cons of iterative and recursive function.
What is overriding, overloading?
Brownie point: When asked to write code on paper, do input validation too. For eg. check if the parameter passed to a function is of the type it is supposed to be.
Difficulty: Medium
How to prepare?
Be thorough with OOPs, they have asked it repeatedly, learn it from different resources as each would give you a different view to it. Learn the examples too!
Revise DSA.
Prepare previously asked questions.
Questions I was asked:-
What type of employer would you choose?
Why do you want to work with Oracle? 
Tell me about your strength and weakness.
Do you know what kind of technologies you will be working on?
How to prepare?
Know about the company, what it does, its products, the technology stack it uses, etc. and you would be good to go.
Tips:
Resume should be crisp - No bluffing.
Take your time for answering questions. How you approach the solution is as important as the solution itself - Make sure they know what you are thinking.
Remember to see every NO as a Next Opportunity.

SERVER TECHNOLOGY
AUTHOR : ARPAN KUNDU
<akundusaltlake@gmail.com>
The first round was an aptitude test where they asked general questions on Mathematics and English and some questions related to Computer Science such as Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, etc. There were also a few questions which would test how careful you are in analysing sensitive information. For example, one question had the credit card numbers of several people which were quite similar but not same and you had to choose the correct credit card number of a person from 4 options which would again be similar but not same. These questions are pretty easy in case you are a bit careful. 
Around 40 people were shortlisted for Server Technology and around 60 for Applications Development from B.Tech and M. Tech CSE, ECE and EEE. 
This round was an interview round where the interviewer first asked questions related to the point I had mentioned in my resume. Then he gave me a problem to solve: 
Input: A tree (not necessarily a binary tree), A, B (say A = 2, B = 4) 
Output
Cut the subtree rooted at A and make it a child of B. 
Then he asked me whether he had not asked a question upon any topic which I had thought he would probably ask a question upon and I said DBMS. Following is the question he asked thereafter: 
Input: A table with the details of father of each person right from Adam. 
Output
➢ Why should you be hired by Oracle? 
➢ Any extra – curricular activities you are interested in? 
➢ What would you do if you have a complete day and given the freedom to do whatever you like. 
➢ A real – life example when you would prefer BFS over DFS and vice – versa. 
There was one more round for Applications Development and finally 6 people (5 B. Tech CSE + 1 M. Tech CSE) from Server Technology (all of whom got placed) and 11 people (10 B. Tech CSE + 1 B. Tech ECE) from Applications Development (10 [9 B. Tech CSE + 1 B. Tech ECE] of whom got placed) went for the final HR Round. 
➢ Tell me something about yourself. 
➢ How are you as a person? (strengths) 
➢ What are your weaknesses? 
➢ Anything in the pre – placement talk which attracted you more to work for Oracle? 
➢ Job Location Preference? 
➢ When would you like to join? (June/July)

<chbhanuprakash1997@gmail.com> 
CTC - 28 lpa
This company’s process is a bit different to others. There were two online rounds.
This is a pen and paper test. It consists of three sections namely quantitative, problem solving and verbal with 20 questions each. This is conducted by ELitmus. Questions were very tough. It would remind you of maths olympiads examinations. Negative marking scheme is again a highlight here. +10 and -5, but the thing is the number of wrong answers should be less than one fourth of the correct answers. Like, if you attempted some Z questions out of which X questions were right and Y were wrong then Y<=X/4. In that case there won’t be any negative marks, otherwise there will be negative marks.
Eg: if you attempted 12 questions, and if 9 were correct and 3 were wrong, then there wouldn’t be negative marks. But if 8 were correct and 4 were wrong, then negative mark would be for the 4th wrong answer but not for the first three.
If you can do 7 questions correct in each section, trust me it’s a good score.
I did 8,7,6 questions in each of those sections.
Suggestion: Be quick, don’t waste time on tough questions.
This was coding round and there were 2 questions.
1st question was very easy and 2nd question was very tough.
1st question was related to strings and 2nd related to graphs.
It was something like this- Given a tree, and there will be treasure in one of the nodes. We can query any node, it will return the node itself if it contains the treasure or returns the branch which leads to the treasure. We need to find out the treasure in minimum number of queries.
My approach - Fix a node as a root and find out the max depth of the tree from dfs. In similar way, do dfs on every node and take the min of all those max depths and the answer will be the log to the base 2 of min(max_depths).
Based on the two rounds, they shortlisted only 3. We were asked to come to Bangalore office for the interview since we were only 3. Thanks to Tnp department, they arranged everything and we went to Bangalore in the night and the next day we had the interview.
It was again a coding round and again 2 questions.
First question-  A slight modification to this-https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/merging-intervals/.
Second question-  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-ladder-problem-2/
I did both the questions.
Interview happened at different cabins at the same time for all of us. In this round only one question was given and we were asked to solve and write the code on the paper.
Question: Given a string, find the minimum number of partitions such that each partition is a palindrome.
First i told him the bruteforce solution (using bitwise operators for generating subsets) , he couldn’t understand at first and after i explained with an example. He convinced that my code works. But the complexity is exponential. Obviously, he asked me to optimise further. After some time i told him the dp solution and wrote the code.
Given a scenario related to operating systems and the code. We were asked to identify bugs in the code.
Scenario- We need to copy the text data from multiple files to a large single file. A thread was assigned to each of the files do this job. Everytime a full line should be written to the output file, we shouldn’t break the line. At a time only 400 chars can be copied to the output file.
Code - C++ code was given with 5-6 functions. It looks really scared.
There was a synchronisation problem. If one thread is writing to the output file, others shouldn’t write. So we need to use mutex here. He asked me to write the modified code. And there was one logical error, after every write, ‘no.of char left’ parameter has to be incremented. And there were some other logical errors, chance of deadlock, memory leakage issues. I identified most of the bugs.
Note: Don’t forget to free pointers at the end.
Interviewer tries to confuse us a lot. But don’t get confused. Don’t simply bluff, they ask on each and every point.
This was the easiest round among all the rounds. 
Question- Given a BST with integers and a value X(not necessarily integer) and a integer K. We need to find out the K values in the BST that are close to the given value X.
I immediately told him the solution.
Solution - Do inorder traversal and store the values in a array/vector. Get the two indexes whose values are less than and greater than X respectively. Take absolute difference of those values with X. Pick the minimum difference and update the K value and move the pointer. Repeat till K becomes zero.
He asked for any improvements that can be done. I told him the binary search approach to find the index whose value is less than the given value. I further modified it for duplicate elements.
He was happy with the solution and the next was a discussion about my projects,internship experience and stuff.
Finally, they selected only one among three and that was luckily me.
General Suggestions(any company): Do coding in holidays, it will help you out in interviews. If interviewer asked you to write the code, write it neatly and clearly. Interact more with the interviewer and ask more questions.  
GOOD LUCK !

There was an online round which had three sections: 1. Debugging: This had 7 questions and we had about 20 minutes to do it. 2. Aptitude/Quants: This had 10 questions and we got 20 minutes again. 3. Coding: There were three questions and we got 60 minutes I think a. 1st was related to binary & and subsets b. 2nd was the application of kadane’s algorithm c. 3rd was based on backtracking 24 students were shortlisted after online round. Time was limited to the sections (no rollover of extra time) 
The interview consisted of four rounds: 
It was mostly related to data structures and algorithms and a few puzzle questions were also asked. The interviewer started with deep copying versus shallow copying and copy constructors and other questions covered Arrays (7), Linked List(3), Dynamic Programming(3), Trees(2), Graphs. The puzzle they asked was There are 25 horses and we don’t have a stopwatch and we want to find the fastest 5 horses. We could run 5 horses at a time. What is the minimum number of races needed to find the fastest 5 horses? He focused more on the approach I had. 
They took 8 students further to the next round 
Here, we were divided into two teams, and had to come up with an idea, prototype it with legos, and present it on chart paper to our "investors". They kept asking us with questions like who the team leader was, and who came up with the idea, how did we divide our time, who did time management, etc. No one got eliminated in this round. 
Here, they started by giving me a list of flights and asked me to give an itinerary so that I don’t have to take any flight twice and which data structure would be best suited for this. Then they asked me to design a system which would take up all the data and based on the data make a prediction when should I invest for Mutual Funds and if yes, at what point of time, and later on evaluate whether it was the right decision or not. They basically asked me to design various tables required to store information. I had to build tables for, among others, the fund and the companies, making sure they had all the relevant columns and were flexible to change. I was guided through this process. Then I was asked to do a class diagram for the system and based on that give an object-oriented design of the system and he asked me to do the methods to check if they did the desired task and in between, he would mention the properties he wanted if I had missed any. 
The round is especially important, so make sure you're familiar with System design and database normalization. Also, it might be helpful to have an idea to be pitched beforehand. And as usual, knowledge of basic CS stuff is important. 
This was the most chill. It started with general stuff like asking me about my hometown and school. But then the interviewer started asking me a lot of behavioral questions about whether I'd take a member for a group project unofficially. And every time I answered, I was asked why this? Why not the other way? In the end, he asked me whether I had any questions for him and we had a very good conversation after this. 
Number of people selected - 1 from MCA, 1 from M. Tech, 1 from B. Tech (for full time)

TECHNOLOGY ANALYST
AUTHOR : SHESHANG M AJWALIA
<sidajwalia@gmail.com>
Cut-Off: 7.5 CGPA
Package: 25.91 LPA
Selected candidates: 2 (1 Mtech, 1 MCA)
They took a written test on the AMCAT which had 3 sections with its own time limit. No navigation between sections but within the section we can. No negative marking, which I forgot and skipped some questions. It had an option for selecting a programming language.
It had 7 debugging questions. Questions were of the form where code stub was given and some set of test cases. Along with that, it was told that whether it has compiler error or logical error. Our task is to find and correct that error so that code stub passes all test cases.
They were pretty easy questions but I missed one as time limit exceeded.
It was an aptitude section with 10 regular kinds of (data interpretation, pattern arrangement, English and some other) aptitude questions. I left 3 questions here which were from single data interpretation set because I was running out of time and this data had very odd and big numbers to deal with.
3 coding problems were given.
1) Given n candies' sweetness, find the maximum K-AND-Value, where K-AND-Value means value we get by anding any k sweetnesses. I did it with recursion but had a wrong base condition so did not pass all cases. One friend did it with same (exponential) complexity and right base condition but still timed out for some cases.
2) Problem definition was very confusing and took a long time to understand what they want. But I figured out finally and solved with brute force. Passed all test cases. It was based on ordered pairs in the array. input size was 10^5 and I thought it will not pass cases with nested for loop, but as I was not able to figure out the more optimal way, I just tried it out and it worked for all test cases.
3) Given storage media as an m*n grid, there are two types of files. System files and Security files. Each cell can contain either of the files. All horizontal and vertical neighbours of the same type of file create a group of maximum size. Due to the virus, we need to add more security files, so that exactly k group of system data files remains in the grid. Find the minimum number of data files we need to remove for this. I did not do this.
Tips:
Don't forget if it has no negative marking.
Prepare data interpretation (with big numbers arithmetic), you will face it in many companies' written.
If you can not find out the optimal way quickly, just start with brute force and check, most of the time, in written test, non-optimal way works. Otherwise, you will waste time and will not be able to attend all the questions.
They shortlisted 24 candidates for interviews.
Interviews had 4 rounds, technical, lego activity, system design and HR.
We were called to TNP block by 1:30 PM and was also given one questionnaire to fill out. It had some couple of questions like, why to join MS, what is your hobby, which book you read last, do you mind relocating, explain your favourite project in 5-6 lines. They collected these questionnaire and resume.
The interviewer made me comfortable with questions on how I feel about hostel and mess food, for how long I am have been here and all. Later we went through the answers I gave in writing. He asked me to explain what I have thought of while answering. That storage media problem I have not attended so he made me solve it there and helped through the process. No pseudocode, no working code, just explain the approach. Use the paper to explain steps on some example grid. Then he asked me about how TreeMap is implemented in Java. He also asked me one very simple SQL query.
He asked me for return questions and I asked one. (Always ask)
After the 1st round, they took 2-3 hours of time for discussion and selected 8 candidates.
2 groups of 4 on either corner of the round table. We were given a set of Lego blocks. Our task was to come up with some innovative product, company logo and tagline, objectives, budget in given amount of time and convince investors (interviewers) to invest in our project. They grilled us with critical strategical questions. All of 10-12 interviewer was in the same room, from here to there noting our every step and each statement (we were instructed to discuss loudly) and marking us. What I observed here was your idea of innovation has less focus, weight was on teamwork, confidence and some sensible answers with quick response time.
No elimination after this.
Tips:
Use group activity for your benefit. Rest all rounds, only one interviewer is talking to you, this group task can help you to get focus and interest of all of them. I referred company's one of the core-value statements while answering and it just worked as a charm.
The interviewer asked me about my MTech project, But only basic, very introductory information. Not even what exact problem definition is and she moved to the question. She asked me to design a system like Amazon-Flipcart e-commerce site. I started by listing down features, then entities, then classes, attributes and methods. I continuously discussed with her and she guided me throughout. I was also supposed to create tables, ER diagram and class diagram but coordinator knocked on the door, it was getting late.
No elimination after this.
Tips:
Go through system design questions. There are two types of system design questions. One is creating an OOP system design, which we were asked and another type of design contains concepts of load balancing, memory management, server allotment, write and read query management and things. Prepare for both. MS weighs a lot on SE and you will get one for sure.
It was very expected set of questions. She grilled with lots of critical situations and I have to tell my stand on them. MS has a very strong side for ethics and so always answer whatever is ethically right. She asked nearly about 20-25 questions. In the end, I asked one question about the company and she responded on it. I appreciated the company culture and we completed the HR round.
Tips:
Be strong on your stand and confident.
They took half more hour for discussion and decision. I obviously had a little bit of anxiety. They finally came out of the room and announced my name. It was a happy ending.:-) Well, it was 1:30 AM-midnight.
Tips:
They did not go through resume walkthrough but during 1st round decision, they used it. So keep your resume impressive enough to speak on behalf of you and fill questionnaire with care. Show your interest in the company. Utilize group activity round for impression. Don't worry about right answers to all problems just let them know that you are thinking in right direction.
Feel free to reach out in case. Thanks to 'Interview Diaries' for helping me in preparation. Best luck to everyone whoever is reading this. :-)

7.5 CGPA and above
Computer science and engineering
Electrical and electronics engineering
Electronics and Communication engineering
Online Examination
Technical Interview
HR Interview
There were three sections in the evaluation:
Debugging Round - To identify and fix bugs in the code
Aptitude Round 
Coding Round – 3 coding questions
Time Management is the key because questions in Debugging and Aptitude Rounds were easy. Coding questions were of medium level and could be cracked with basic knowledge in data structures and prior experience in coding within a given time frame. Questions were array based (1D and 2D)
The interviewer was very friendly. He introduced himself and asked to tell about myself. Data Structures & Algorithms and OOPs concepts were mainly asked.
Different sorting algorithms and their complexities. Also he gave a lot of sample inputs and asked which algorithm will work better (Nearly sorted array , Array with adjacent elements swapped)
Given a number n, find the smallest number that has same set of digits as n and is greater than n. If x is the greatest possible number with its set of digits, then print “not possible”
How to sort an array and a linked list with only 0s,1s and 2s. I gave different algorithms and he kept on asking about better methods ( O(n) and constant space instead of O(2n) ). In case of array I knew the “Dutch national flag problem” which can sort in a single traversal and in case of linked list told a method using 3 pointers (one for each number) which can sort in one traversal .
Questions regarding removing duplicates from array.
Questions on hashing techniques.
Brief Discussion about subjects I studied and about my Resume.
OOPs concepts are also important.
The interviewer was very much friendly. She asked about my strengths and asked to tell situations in life where I could make a difference. He also gave a lot of situations and asked me how I will respond to them, e.g.
Your senior officer is found to be working illegal
You find people in your project not making an effort
You find your best friend taking credit for work he/she has copied
You are given a work to be completed in a timeline that is impossible
Do u dare to do something unconventional over a limited time frame.
Many such situations were given. The key is to communicate with the interviewer and make a healthy conversation.
At last when asked if any questions , I asked about the experiences at the firm and how easy it will be to handle the above situations as an employee of the company( like if u find the senior officer or project manager doing something illegal).
The overall interview experience was very nice. Data structures and Algorithms is really important ( for online test and technical rounds) . Also OOPs questions (At least basic concepts).

    Pen and Paper test (2 or 3 questions)
1) given BST, kth smallest element
2) Largest subarray divisible by k
    All programming questions
    DSA and their complexities.

    Round 1- Technical
1) given a string, rearrange in such a way that consonant and vowel comes alternate, the order should be maintained.
2) given a matrix where each row is sorted, search for an element that is common in each row.
[everyone answered but shortlisted only those that gave the best time and space complexity]
   Round 2- Technical
1) n elements- 1,2,3, ..., n. If one of them is missing how do you find it if (a) it's sorted, (b) not sorted, (c) if one is missing and another is repeated
-->best answer: O(log n), O(n), O(n) respectively
2) for n elements find kth largest element. --> O(n log n) and O(nk) are easy. There is an uncommon solution that I presented to the interviewer who was also new to it but was quite happy with my approach, takes O(n log k). Give it a try. There's another solution which takes O(n + k log n). I don't think there can be any better solution than these two.
3) for n numbers, find the highest frequency count of a no.
    Round 3- HR
Usual questions, some basic questions about my ongoing project and how I am adjusting in college
    They focused on DSA and programming skills. Thorough understanding of DSA is a must. Regular programming in online contest will be of huge help. System Design round is must.

Package: 9 LPA 
The interview consisted of a pen and paper coding round, followed by interview rounds for the selected students after the coding round. 
Round1 (Pen and Paper Based): The first round consists of three questions and the duration was 75 minutes. As it is a pen and paper based test, pseudo code is enough. -finding a subsequence of given size whose sum is equal to given sum. 
- Given a post order traversal of a binary tree and an array which tells whether it is a leaf node or a non-leaf node. Construct the binary tree out of it. There are multiple ways possible. We need to give one. No extra space was allowed but we could use recursion. 
-given a binary search tree whose two nodes are violating its property. you have to detect those nodes. 
Round 2: Find the maximum element in a 2d-array and the code must be efficient. Check whether the string consists of balanced parenthesis. 
Round 3: Construct a Binary Tree from Postorder and Inorder Traversals. I started with brute force solution and then came up with O(n) solution. 
Round 4 (HR Interview): In this round i was asked questions like “tell me about yourself”, ”family background”, “Why Factset”. 
Suggestion: 
This company only focus on data structures and algorithms and expects the most optimized solution from you. 
Reference Material: 
I found that Geeksforgeeks and Karumanchi Data Structures and Algorithms are the best sources to crack this interview.

It was an online coding contest, Tech Set Go conducted on http://techsetgo.mettl.com. There was a CGPA cutoff of 7. The test had three questions. All the questions were array questions and were easy. I solved all of them but for each question I got one failed test case. I wrote the code in Python3.
I got an email after a month stating that I got qualified for the second round of Tech Set Go and later they informed me about the dates and location(Bangalore). 
As there was a gap between the the announcement of the results and the interview I had time to prepare. I went through the Microsoft archives in GeeksforGeeks and started doing questions there. I didn't code but instead wrote my code down on paper and this helped me a lot in all the rounds I attended. I asked about the selection process to my seniors and also the CSEA Interview diaries helped.
There were about a hundred candidates on the first round and about eighteen from Nit Calicut. The first round was called a Group Fly. All the candidates were divided into groups of four and one mentor was assigned to four groups. They gave two questions and we had to write compilable code in any language.  
Question 1
Boundary traversal of  a binary tree.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree
Question 2
Decode a string recursively encoded as count followed by substring
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decode-string-recursively-encoded-count-followed-substring
For this question instead of using a stack. I recursively called the function again whenever I saw a “[<string>]”.
We had about forty five minutes to solve the questions and I was able to finish it in thirty five minutes which gave me a huge advantage which I will mention later. I wrote solutions for all the questions using Python3. Writing code in Python was easier and also it was easy to read. As I solved early, my mentor had enough time to check my solutions and as he was not clear about the recursive approach I took in my second question, he asked me to explain it. Clearing your doubts regarding the question or explaining your approach with the mentor is very important because there would be a lot of people who answers the question correctly but they shortlisted only a few people to the next round. So try to communicate with your mentor.
Sixteen people were selected to the interview rounds and five got eliminated after the first round of interview. All the others had three interviews. 
Interview 1
First interview started with questions from my resume, about my work experiences and projects. Then he asked me two DSA questions which I had to write compilable code on paper(not pseudo code).
Question 1
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/closest-leaf-to-a-given-node-in-binary-tree
There was modification to this question as I had to find distance only from the root and also had to do it in minimum time(Use level order traversal).
Question 2
Find the number occurring odd number of times
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-number-occurring-odd-number-of-times/
I did this question using bitwise XOR approach.
The interviewer also asked me questions about pentesting, Web Security, XSS, SQLi etc because I had these in my resume.
Interview 2
My second interviewer asked me two questions question(had to write compilable code on paper).
Question 1 
Given a function isValidWord(word) and string. Convert the string into a meaningful sentence. (Use backtracking)
Question 2
Given  a number we had to print the count of the number with the number and repeat it n times.
2
1 2
1 1 1 2
3 1 1 2
1 3 2 1 1 2
He asked me some networking questions like the structure of a Https request, making a http request with Javascript, structure of an Ajax request etc.
Both of these interviews took more than an hour as the interviewers talked a lot about the work they do and the challenges they face.
Interview 3
The last interview was a short one where she asked me three questions(had to write compilable code on paper).
Question 1 
Reverse words in a given string
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-words-in-a-given-string
Question 2
Remove all occurrences of a character in a string
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-all-occurrences-of-a-character-in-a-string
Question 3
Readers-Writers problem
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/readers-writers-problem-set-1-introduction-and-readers-preference-solution
In all the interviews I was able to answer most of the questions easily but wherever I had problems the interviewers helped a lot. They were very friendly and supportive.
This was the end of the interview and we got our results after two or three weeks through mail. Three of us from Nit Calicut were selected.

Microsoft visited our campus in 2017-18 academic year for our seniors.But this year for some reasons,they didn't come to our campus.Then Microsoft conducted online recruiting drive and they released a notication in Linkedin in the month of Dec 2018.
CGPA Cutoff: 7 with no pending backlogs
This round comprises of three coding questions to be solved in 90 mins.
Note: Questions are not same for all students.
You are given a matrix and you need to find minimum cost to reach from source cell to destination cell.The possible moves are left,right,diagonally right,diagonally left and down.There is also time constraint for this question
One simple array rearrangement problem based on how Alt+Tab works.
A string manipulation problem which I don't remember exactly.
The Online round was conducted in the first week of Jan’19 and results were announced on Jan 25 and I was able to qualify for interviews.About 16 students qualified from NIT Calicut and we were called for off-campus interviews at Microsoft IDC,Banglore.
There were around 100 students from various colleges and we were given a brief introduction about the interview procedure.
It was a paper and pen coding round and we were given 60 mins to solve two questions
You are given a binary tree and you are asked to print boundary nodes of the tree in anti-clockwise manner.
           (It is a direct question from Geeks For Geeks)
          Link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/
Given an input string S.You need to print the string in the following manner.
        Ex: Input: 3[a]                     Output: aaa
              Input: 2[abc[3[e]]]         Output: abceeeabceee
Note: You need to write the exact working code in any language of your choice.Make sure you write the code neatly so that the evaluator can understand. Be active and ask for any clarification that is required.
16 members(5 from NIT Calicut) were shortlisted for further rounds.
There were three interview rounds for me.But it may vary for others.There may be an additional fourth round if required.
The interviewer is a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft.As soon as I entered the room,there was a white-board waiting for me.He wrote some topics on the board and asked me to explain them in detail.
Queues and priority queues
Operations on queues and Priority queues and how do you implement them?
Derive time complexity of Build-Max-Heap
           Link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/time-complexity-of-building-a-heap/
You are given a large no of arrays of variable sizes on which only Get-Min (Returns min element in array) operation is defined.Write a working code to return min element of all arrays combined in every iteration.
Where priority queues are used? I answered scheduling of jobs.
He then quickly moved to OS and asked me about what is scheduling,scheduling algorithms,starvation and all the topics related to it.
Then he asked me a question which is an application of Multi-Level feedback scheduler.We have 10 high-priority,10 medium priority and 10 low priority jobs initially.And there will be incoming jobs of different priorities.
Design an efficient scheduler so as to eliminate starvation and high priority jobs are always alloted CPU quickly.
I suggested an approach similar to multi-level feedback queue scheduler but he asked me to think of more efficient method.Then I suggested an approach involving Round-Robin + shortest job first in each level of multi-level feedback scheduler and he seemed to be satisfied with that approach.
Four people were asked to leave after this round.
Search a word in a 2d array of characters.
     Link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-a-word-in-a-2d-grid-of-characters/
In a hotel,there are no of persons arriving and leaving every single day and the rooms are single-bed rooms.Given a sequence of dates with arrival count and departure count ,return the minimum no of rooms required to accommodate them.
     Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-platforms-required-railwaybus-station/
Given a string remove duplicates from string
       Ex: input: Hello    output: Helo
Remove all duplicates from string
       Ex: input: Hello   output:Heo
OOPS concepts:
               Polymorphism,Inheritance(Multi-Level and Multiple Inheritance),Virtual function,
               Pure virtual function and virtual class.
I was given a C code.I need to make any optimisation that I can do on that code.
Brief discussion about OS(Xos) project I did.
After that ,he asked me if I have any questions for him.I just asked him about the project that he is currently working on and about work culture at microsoft.He told me that you have HR round left and wished me all the best. And I was made to wait for almost an hour after this round.
The interviewer is a hiring manager and I thought it would be a pure HR round.But it turned out to be a pure technical round.
He has a detailed feedback of my last two rounds and group fly round.After having some discussion on previous rounds, he asked me following questions.
What is binary search and binary search tree and comparison between the search,insert and delete operations.
What if binary search tree is skewed?(I answered AVL and Red-black trees)
What are system calls and interrupts?
What are different process and file system calls and explain them.
Few Linux commands
You are given a large file(Say a 30GB) file and your RAM is low(Say 2GB) and you need to read last 10 lines of the file in the most efficient way using system calls.It is actually implementing own tail system call.
After that,Sir asked me if I had questions for him.And I asked him questions like "What motivates you to work at microsoft?" and "What is the kind of work that I would be working on as an intern?".
After that he told that my interview was over and I was asked to leave.Results were announced exactly two weeks after the interviews on March 25th and I was one among them. 
Three from our college(including me) selected for internship with Microsoft.
Position and Stipend:
Software Engineering Intern
Stipend of Rs 80,000/month + Other benefits
Preparation Tips:
Practice coding on Hackerrank,interviewbit,Hackerearth etc.,
I would recommend "Data structures and algorithms By Narasimha karumanchi" along with Geeks for Geeks as the best source for preparation.It is good to read important chapters in “Crack The Coding Interview” book as well.
Try writing the entire working code on paper even though you know the approach to it.
Be confident and honest while answering questions.
Study DP,Greedy and Backtracking and practice as many problems as possible since almost every top company asks questions from these three topics.
I would strongly recommend to go through previously asked questions of a particular company before attending interviews.
I hope my interview experience and tips will help you in your interview preparation and I wish you all the best.

Microsoft had done an off campus internship drive during my 6th sem.The link was circulated in our class group. I had already been offered internship at Qualcomm during my 5th sem but as the drive was not directly through T&P, students with stipends less than 50k were allowed to appear for the test. All the information regarding the interviews and result were communicated directly to us.
The online coding round was conducted by Mettl, an online assessment platform. The online test had three coding questions with 90 minutes to attempt all three questions. The 3 questions were simple programming questions mainly to test how well you covered all the end cases. There were multiple sets of questions. The questions in my set were:
Given n sweets and k kids distribute the sweets among the kids such that the ith kid gets i sweets.Continuing in the same fashion,if after distributing to all the kids sweets are still left then in the subsequent rounds(say jth round) the 1st kid gets ( j-1)*k+1 sweets, the 2nd kid ( j-1)*k+2 sweets and so on. Output the sweets that each kid received.
ALT + TAB keys are used to quickly switch between running apps in your system.The apps are ordered in decreasing order of access-holding down the ALT key and then tapping TAB k times chooses the kth recently run application and the application list gets updated so that this application appears as the most recent one. Given an initial ordering of applications and the subsequent k values output the final ordering of applications.
Find the maximum depth of nested brackets.Eg: { [ ( ) ] { } } [ ] has depth 3.
I was able to do all the 3 questions. But, those who could not complete all the 3 also qualified to next round.Assessment was done based on completeness of the code, boundary conditions, performance of the code and complexity level of the code. Overall there were around 20 students selected from our college alone.
The short listed students from the online round were asked to report at Microsoft India Development Center in Bengaluru. We were asked to fill a form stating our interested subjects before we appeared for the interview. This played a major role in the face to face interviews. There were about 200 candidates from different colleges. We were initially briefed by a team of current employees on what constitutes an internship under Microsoft. We were then lead to a room for the 1st round.
The 1st round was a pen and paper coding round. We were seated in groups and invigilators were assigned to a set of groups. We were given 2 questions and an hour to write the working code(NOT pseudo code) for both:
Print the boundary nodes of a binary tree. (Link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boundary-traversal-of-binary-tree/)
Decode a string recursively encoded. (Link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decode-string-recursively-encoded-count-followed-substring/)
The invigilators were available for any kind of clarification about the constraints of the questions.For instance,on enquiry it was told that we could use STL if necessary. The invigilators occasionally asked questions in between regarding our solution. Completing the solution earlier gives you an added advantage as the invigilators concentrated more on people who have finished. After the allotted time they further analysed the papers and finally 16 of us were shortlisted again. Next came 3 rounds of face to face interview. 
For this round of interview, I was asked about the subjects I was currently studying. They also asked me if I had thought of the major project I would do in my final year.Thankfully, I had already thought about it and was able to answer satisfactorily. I was once again asked to write the complete code for the following questions:
Remove duplicates from a given string
(Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/remove-duplicates-from-a-given-string/).
I was asked to improve the solution that I had suggested. Finally I was able to convince
the interviewer of my solution.
I was given a database scenario and asked about the concurrency issues faced if multiple users update the DB at the same time. I was also asked to write the code for a lock technique for concurrency control. I had to deal with different variations such as  giving equal weightage to reader and writer on a first come first serve basis and then later changing it so that if no writer is currently accessing the DB, a reader can access it allowing multiple readers to access the DB at the same time while the writers can access it individually only if there are no readers or other writers accessing the DB. I guess their line of questioning was based on the interest form that I had mentioned above as I had specified OS among other subjects.I was able to do both questions satisfactorily.
This round started off by asking me to introduce myself. I was asked about my hobbies and other interests. I was asked if I had any prior experience in competitive coding. I was embarrassed to tell them that I had none.I was also asked how my 1st  pen and paper round had gone and if there were any modifications to be made to make the code work properly. I had not covered some end cases and I said so. After this I was given another problem to solve-
Point to next higher value node in a linked list with an arbitrary pointer 
(Link:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/point-to-next-higher-value-node-in-a-linked-list-with-an-arbitrary-pointer/) .
I was again questioned about semaphores, mutex, its importance and its applications.
For my last round, I was interviewed by one of the project managers. The questions asked in this round were mostly real life problems and they wanted to see how we handled them. The questions asked were:
I had specified Principles of Programming Languages in my interested courses, and he asked me questions about the memory size of an integer and memory size of a pointer in a C++. 
I was asked about the range of one’s complement and two’s complement. 
I was given a real life problem- there is hard disk and there are 4 arms used to read. Requests come to a queue in the software driver and it is further forwarded to multiple buffers such that the requests to a particular cylinder is in the same buffer. The main overhead is the seek time. I had to device an algorithm by which the buffers are efficiently chosen so that there is no starvation of any of the requests. It was hard and I was only able to get solution for speed constraint (processing smaller requests first) and time constraint (processing requests which have been waiting longer) individually and was not able to combine the two solution to get a better overall solution. The solution was to assign coefficient(x, y) to each constraint and choose the buffer such that the net value(x * size of the request+ y * time in buffer) crosses a threshold. 
Given two numbers m and n, both 64 bit numbers, count the numbers between m and n that has exactly 4 ones set in its binary representation. This too was pretty hard and I ended up giving an approximate answer using combinatorics. But the interviewer was happy with the solution offered. It turned out that finding the exact answer was practically hard and the approach I suggested was not the solution that he had in mind so he was happy when I could convey the solution properly.
At the end of the rounds it was informed that the result will be informed via mail. In the end 3 of us were selected from NITC
Some things that I would like to add:
Going through the interview diaries and the interview archives of geeksforgeeks helped me prepare for the interviews. I was mentally prepared for 4 rounds. This was the first time I was experiencing such rigorous examination.
Practice coding on pen and paper.Interviews at Microsoft are known to require you to write the complete code. Also revising the STL classes syntax gives you a decided advantage.
Be honest. During my 3rd round of face to face interview I was asked whether I was comfortable with binary trees. I truthfully told them I was not. So he instead gave me a linked list question which I was able to answer easily. It is better to admit not knowing something instead of trying to answer something that you are not confident about.
Use proper meaningful names for variables. I had used some lousy names and the interviewer initially was confused about the logic behind the solution because of the naming convention I used.
Relax. During round 2, I had initially gone blank during the initial pleasantries. The interviewer sensing my discomfort immediately put me at ease. Most of the interviewers are pleasant and try to help you as much as possible.
I was worried that I did not have an impressive resume or any experience in competitive coding. But it is your performance there that counts. They test your fundamentals. Having a proper knowledge of core subjects helped.
You are allowed to ask questions at the end of each round. Prepare these questions well in advance. They appreciate it when you ask relevant questions. Don’t keep repeating the same questions.
For the coding questions, they asked me to create test cases for the problem. This was to ensure I had thought of all the end cases without leaving anything out.
My final round was much more intimidating than the other rounds. The project manager told me outright that I had not done well in the previous rounds. And unlike the previous rounds, he did not provide me any assistance while I tried to solve the problems. I guess he was testing how well I coped under stress. He was more concerned about the thinking process rather that getting the correct solution.
I hope this article helped get an overall idea of the entire process. All the best!

CGPA CUTOFF: 7
CTC: 11.5LPA
The students were shortlisted for the interview based on online coding test consisting of 50 aptitude questions and 2 coding questions. 
The interview comprised of four rounds.
The first round was a technical one. The interviewer was a young engineer from Micro Focus. The questions were mostly theoretical, based on OOPS concepts and Networking Layers. Then I  was asked to write codes of a pattern printing program and an array manipulation question. I was also questioned on my internships and major projects and had to explain why I wanted a coding job despite being from ECE.
The second round was also technical, conducted by a more senior employee. In this round I was asked to write codes and optimize them. The questions were designed to test your logic rather than your programming skills. I was also asked bit manipulation questions and some puzzles. 
The third round was the longest for me. I was interviewed by an NITC alumnus and was asked a mixture of technical and HR questions. Initially I was asked to introduce myself and tell him something interesting about me, my strengths and weaknesses etc. I was questioned on why I chose ECE and why I wanted Micro Focus. My advice about such questions is to be frank rather than go for tailor made answers. Then I was given the task of developing a product idea for the company and pitching it. I came up with three ideas and he seemed impressed. One thing that we talked about a lot was my major project as it is related to IOT and Data mining and I was able to link it to the kind of work they would be doing in the company. I think that helped my prospects a lot since all the four interviewers were curious about it. 
The round felt more like a discussion than an interview. All the interviewers I had were open, friendly and encouraging, and this interviewer in particular was very helpful in the sense that he gave me feedback towards the end of the interview on how I performed. They were testing the personality and your communication and interpersonal skills more than your aptitude. The key for acing the round is to be confident and to engage the interviewer. Always have questions prepared to ask the interviewer. This will show the interviewer you are interested in the company and the position.
The final round was a very short HR round. It had a lot of repeated questions from the previous round( my background, strengths, weaknesses etc). I was asked about my hobbies and we had a short discussion on our favourite books. I was asked to explain why I would be a good fit for the company and what I should focus on to prepare myself for the job. All in all it was a very informal round. 
To summarize- know your resume and know the company. Always try to link your strengths and the works you’ve done to how it will make you a better fit for the job. Be polite, confident and proactive with your answers.

Round 1:
Test Duration: 30 mins
The first round comprised of 25 MCQ questions including aptitude and logical portions. The questions were not very difficult but were very tricky.
Suggestion: Dont spend too much time on any question if you are not able to do it in the first attempt.
Round 2:
The second round was a technical interview.
The interview started with questions about my project mentioned in the resume. They asked me to explain the project from scratch. They asked my contribution in the project and why I chose that. As it was a DBMS project and I worked mostly on frontend, they asked me to write an HTML code (a form with few specified validations) and a few SQL queries. They also questioned about DBMS concepts like keys and transactions.
Later, they asked me to write a code for a linked list question and asked about hashing concepts. Next, they asked me to write a code using python, as I didn't know python I gently told them that I can't code in python and they were totally okay with it. More questions were asked from OOP concepts and basics of Machine Learning.
Finally, I was asked to solve an aptitude question. Apparently, they didn't really want the answer to that question but wanted to know the method I was using to solve it.
Round 3:
The third round was an HR interview.
This round was mainly to check our communication skills and spontaneity. The interview started with the usual 'Tell me about yourself'. The remaining  questions were mostly like why I chose CSE, what are my interests outside academics, what do I not expect from the corporate field, reasons why they shouldn't hire me, etc. You just need to be confident and spontaneous enough to answer the questions.
They gave me enough time to answer the questions both in technical and HR round. Questions were asked based on my resume, so I suggest to be thorough with everything written in the resume. The interviewers were friendly and the whole process was somewhat informal.

Coding round on hirevue.com
There were two questions each with different time limits attached to it.
Question 1 (in 20 mins): Given coins of value 1,3,5 find the minimum number of these coins needed to make a value of M(given)
Example:
14 : 5+5+3+1 
Solution : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-number-of-coins-that-make-a-change/
Question 2 (in 40 mins) : Given a number N, find the reverse of N, if N is equal to the reverse of N, take the new N to be (N+reverse(N)) and continue this till you get an N which is not equal to reverse of N. The question was to output N or to output the number of time you have to perform addition before you find the N.
I/P : n=121
reverse=121 newn=242 newn=482 newn=964 reverse=469 
O/P : 964
Around 40 people were shortlisted for the interview. (Around 35 CS students from the 65-70 people who wrote the test.)
There were 3 rounds in total. 2 Technical and 1 HR .The interviews were all one on one.
A scan through of the resume. I was asked to explain the latest project that I had done. What are OOP concepts? Simple question on DBMS, to write a SQL query. What are the programming languages that you are comfortable with? Why this language other another popular ones? 
I was asked to write two complete programs for simple questions based on strings. And the interview concluded with a simple puzzle (cut a cake into 8 pieces by cutting it only 3 times hint: make one cut horizontally) . 
Around 12 students were shortlisted for the second round of interviews. 
My first question was Why should we hire you? Try to align your interests with the interests of the company and make it sound like both parties will benefit from hiring you. Even if you haven’t researched the company (which is a bad idea), pay attention to the PPT, you should be able to make a sound argument from this.
They wanted to know exactly what I had done for my internship. What were the technologies used, etc. What are your areas of interest (make sure you have a thorough read about your area of interest beforehand)?
Other questions were, what are function pointers and how are they used. What are the different types of inheritance? Why doesn’t Java allow multiple inheritance (I had Java on my resume). What is an outer join? Is a Left Inner Join possible? 
Around 9 students made it to the HR round.
Basic questions about your background etc.
They hired 4 students. (and gave PPOs to all 7/8 interns)
Make sure you are thorough with everything you claim to know in your resume. Identify your weak spots and work on them. Be it DSA/Operating Systems, your grades or communication skills. Try to be prepared for likely question. If you didn’t do an internship after your third year, they’ll most likely ask you why that is. Its best to have a rough answer in mind. Work on competitive coding (I used HackerRank and HackerEarth) and learn to write code on paper. Make sure you read about the company before applying for it.
Don’t take the HR round lightly, around 5 students were eliminated in this round.

Hey!
This is my internship interview experience of JP Morgan.
I got in along with 7 others after 6.5 hours of interviewing.
All fatigue goes away when the volunteer comes up and says that you have been selected and you come to realization that maybe you did not waste your entire college life playing games. I will go over my experience as well as preparation tips that you can have if you want.  
JP Morgan conducted an online test which had 2 questions. Both the questions were superrrr easy and many people left the hall after less than 30 minutes. First question was finding the minimum number of coins needed to arrive at a total. The denominations were of 1, 3 and 6. The second question was about doing some simple mathematical operation by which after repeated applications, you would have the first and last digit as the same. Again easy. 37 people qualified for the interviews.
After getting shortlisted, I talked to people who got in last year and also did research on the company. Working on my resume was not difficult because I had not done much, lol. I included all the languages I knew and added my proficiency level just so that the interviewee would know that I cannot answer the difficult questions about the language. I did not add anything I could not talk about for more than 2 minutes. I added some present and future projects, one of which was a virtual stock trading game that was featured in Tathva. I had not written any code for it at that time but since, I could talk about the stuff we were planning on doing, it did not violate the “2 minute” rule above and so I added it in my resume (Big risk!). You should listen in to the PPT (not PowerPoint but ‘Pre-Placement Talk’) well and try to form questions based on it.
There were 3 interview rounds. My first round was getting screened on the basis of resume, the second round was the technical round and the last one was HR round. 
The first round was pretty straightforward. The interviewee asked me theoretical questions and I replied, “I don’t know” :P  . You don’t have to answer all the questions and if you get stuck on one, you can tell the interviewee that you don’t know so that you can move on to the next one quickly. For hyper-difficult questions like “Tell me about yourself/hobbies/strengths/weaknesses”, I usually try to gain insight from my recent works. This is a subjective question so any approach works. You should know your resume thoroughly well. Read it 3-4 times and you will know your strengths and weaknesses. If you see that the interviewee is probing on the weakness of your resume, you should describe your proficiency level and what all stuff you can or cannot do because if you say you know something and get stuck on later, it will leave you in a bad place with the interviewee. When he asked me about the virtual stock trading game, I told him that I have not written any code but I can tell him how we are implementing the stuff. He asked whether I wanted to ask him any questions and I did (you should also try to ask questions) and my interview ended after that. 15 of us qualified for the next one. Most of the people who qualified had this thing in common that we had some skill that we acquired outside of our classrooms (mine was Python and skills attained from working on the projects).
The second round was the technical round. It included a coding question and some questions based on DSA. Even if you guys are not planning to do anything during vacations, do brush up on DSA. Many people, like me did not have much skills compared to the rest of our class and being good in DSA becomes a savior for us. Read the geeksforgeeks Intern experience of the company to know what type of questions will come. Reading all the articles about the company will definitely give you an idea about the type of questions that would come, and it did. Even if it was a technical round, your approach is what they look for the most and the only way they will know how you arrived at the answer is when you talk about it. So when you are working on the problem, try to talk as much as possible about what you are thinking. There should not be long silences between you and the interviewee. If your approach is correct but you are having difficulty coming at the answer, the interviewee might even help you. Even for basic questions, do talk at least 30 seconds about how you arrived at the answer (Yes! Talk 30 seconds about why 1+1=2). After I answered the DSA questions and solved the coding problem, they asked me if I wanted to know anything about the company and I did. 8 of us qualified for the next round.    
The last round was HR round that tests your communication skills and whether you are a good fit for the company or not. This is the chilliest round and the guy asked me about my background and about my experiences living in Kerala and how it’s different from North India. Everyone who went for this round qualified and we were selected as Interns for JP Morgan and Chase (yay! :D ).
Overall, the experience was pretty chill. The interviewees were nice and made me feel comfortable before every round. I guess if you are calm then it will be chill for you as well. These were my experiences and if you guys need any clarifications about any round, then DM me.
Tadaa!

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
AUTHOR : DHEERAJ 
Hey! This is my internship interview experience. I'm going to describe how the recruitment experience was for me along with the things which I felt as important for performing well for the internship drive. So J.P Morgan was the fourth company to come for the recruitment and it was also the first time that I got shortlisted for an interview. I still remember the huge sigh of relief and the happiness knowing that I got in, which put an end to all those anxious days. I will first describe the process the company followed and then tell what I felt as important for cracking it.
Unlike many companies, JPMC only had a coding test and no aptitude questions for the first round. The coding round had 2 questions which were quite easy.
What helped me crack this round?
During the summer vacation, I had worked on my coding skills. www.a2oj.com is a great website where you have different ladders which help you to start at your current skill level and improve gradually by going up the ladder. Do try it out. Along with that, I had participated in all the Codechef contests which helped me analyze my progress and to compare myself with my counterparts.
After the coding test, around 37 of us were shortlisted for the interview. The interview had 3 rounds
In the first round, I was asked to write the program for some common coding questions. I was also asked some questions on C++ since I had mentioned that I'm proficient in C++ in my resume.
Around 20 of us made it to the second round
In the second round which was handled by the senior professionals of the company, I was mostly asked questions from DSA. The interviewers were pretty chill. They started off with a casual discussion regarding the floods which helped me feel comfortable. The questions were a bit tricky and were mostly about choosing the right data structures and the right algorithm for different problems. They gave me the scenarios and I had to tell them the right choice. They also scrutinized my resume and asked me questions about the summer projects which I did. They also randomly picked things I had written on the resume and asked me to speak more about it.
What helped me crack this round?
Interviews are the trickiest part of this process. You need good fundamentals in DSA to crack the technical rounds. My suggestion is to be well aware of the major data structures which you have learned and also be thorough with the common algorithms. Geeksforgeeks is a great website where you can find most of the important stuff to prepare for interviews. The other part of this round is about your resume. I found JPMC to be one company which gives so much importance to your resume. The thumb rule is not to mention anything which you aren’t good at, in the resume. They scanned through the resume and asked me questions regarding almost everything I had written. I had attended an online machine learning course during the vacation and that helped me add two projects to my resume, which helped me during the interview. Try to do a good project during the vacation which is an invaluable addition to your resume. You don’t need to have a lengthy resume. You just need to have a few things which you are good at. Being a master of one is better than being a jack of all trades.
8 of us made it to the final round.
The HR round was just like what I expected it to be. The interviewer asked me about my hobbies, things which I'm good at, and also the non-technical aspects about me that I had mentioned in my resume. In the end, he asked me if I have any questions and I did ask him one.
What helped me crack this round?
The basic point is to show the HR that you are good at communicating with others that will showcase you as a team player. I had put in all the events which I was part of and the positions of responsibility which I had assumed. That helped me create a conversation with the interviewer.
The results were announced and all 8 of us who made it to the last round were selected. We were really happy that none of us who were in the TnP right then had to go back to the hostel with a rejection.
There are a few other things which I felt, in general, will help you a lot during the process.
First of all, don’t let the process take a toll on you. You might get tensed, but always remain calm. Not getting an internship is not the end of your life. Trust yourself and be confident.
Do not panic during the coding tests. Read the question(s) properly, take time to analyze the question(s) and solve them. Also if there are MCQs, make sure you go through all of them and that you don’t waste time by getting stuck at one question.
Listen to the PPTs of the companies properly and ask questions if you can. Also, learn more about the company online before appearing for the company.
This might sound cliche, but do sleep well before the interview. Stay fresh throughout the interview. I have always felt that the vibes you give to the interviewer do matter a lot. Be smart in front of him/her. Take a few deep breaths before the interview. This will help you stay calm. The questions can get tough. But do not panic, stay cool and start trying. While you are solving a question, speak to the interviewer. This will let him know your thought process which will leave an impression even if you don’t solve the question. Have a smile always.
Have a clean resume. It should be sharp and on to the point. Don’t clutter it with stuff you’re not good at just to make it full. Remember, quality not quantity. Be ready to face questions from any of the points mentioned in your resume. Find more about the company and if you feel that you have done something which is relevant to the company, highlight those points during the interview.
If you do not know the answer to a question, try answering with the knowledge you have. And if you think you’re done, tell that you have limited knowledge in the particular topic. It’s not a sin to tell that you don’t know things.
Always try to speak about the current topic during the interview and try not to have long gaps of silence. It’s awkward and will make you tensed.
The basic aim is to get the interviewer interested in you and to leave a good impression. Be smart. You don’t have to be a nerd to get an internship. I had basic coding skills and DSA knowledge before the summer vacation. Work on making yourself better as much as you can. It will surely help you sometime. Feel free to ping me if you have any other queries, either regarding the interview or the regarding the internship at JPMC. Good luck to you!

CGPA cutoff - 6.5
There were 3 coding questions.
1)  A string is given as input. You should return the smallest palindrome in the string. (20 marks)
Input - random
Output - a
Ans. Return the alphabet having lowest ascii value. Smallest palindrome always has a single character.
2) There are N cities and each city is represented by a value. N and the values associated are given as input.
A person can only move from city of a lower index to larger index(eg:1 to 2,2 to N, 1 to 3)  He can only move from one city to another if the value associated with the first city exactly divides the value of the second city.
We should add the values of the cities that he passes by. Find the max possible total value. ( 50 marks)
Testcase :
Input :
6
1 2 3 4 8 9
Output: 15
(He can move from city 1 to 2[1 divides 2] to 4 [2 divides 4] to 5 [4 divides 8]. So the output is 1+2+4+8=15)
3) The third question was related to graphs(50 marks)
There were about 50 multiple choice questions. These included both technical and aptitude questions. Mcqs were relatively easy.
About 20 students got shortlisted for the interviews.
There were 2 rounds(1 Technical and 1 HR)
1) Technical -
Most of the questions were about the projects I had done.
Basic DBMS and Networks questions were asked. I was also asked to write some SQL queries. Some of the other questions were -
Difference b/w void and null.
What do you know about IoT, Cloud Computing?
2)  HR -  Usual questions (Introduce yourself, strengths, weakness etc)
3 people were selected. (One each from CSE, ECE and EEE)

AUTHOR : AKULA SWATHY
Round 1: The first round consisted of 30 technical questions to be solved in 45 minutes. The questions were asked from Data structures, OS, DBMS. The questions where like what would be the output after 4th iteration of the given array using quicksort with the first element as the pivot element, time complexity of a recurrence equation using master’s theorem, Given a binary tree and set of all elements find the order followed by them(inorder,postorder,preorder), from OS question on banker’s algorithm, what is medium term scheduler, given 4 processes and their burst times and time quantum find the average wait time and average turnaround time using Round robin scheduling, from DBMS questions on transactions like given two transactions find if they are conflict serializable. 
Round 2: 
Coding Round: 
It consisted of 4 questions, 2 questions for 5 marks each and 2 other for 10 marks each. 
4 Questions: 
1. Given a number find the number of cases in which consecutive digits of the given number are divisible 
by 11. Ex: input: 111 output: 1 Explanation: 11 is divisible by 11, 111 is not divisible by 11 
2. Given two strings a regular expression and a string find if they both match 
    Ex: Input: g*d 
                    good 
          Output: yes 
3. Given an array of integers find the maximum subset sum 
4. If an array contained [1, 10, 3, 5, 2, 7] and k = 2, combine the set as {110, 35, 27}, sort the set {27, 35, 110} and split the set into array as [2, 7, 3, 5, 1, 10] 
Whoever solved minimum 2 questions where shortlisted for the interview. Most of the questions were asked from previous archives. 
There were 5 rounds, 3 technical and 2 hr. 
Round 1(Technical round): First the interviewer asked me to introduce myself. Then asked my interested area. I said Data structures, then the questions he asked were like: 1. What is a tree 2. What is the difference between a tree and a binary tree 3. Write code to print the right view of a binary tree 4. Write code to reverse a linked list pairwise 5. What is a binary search tree and where is it useful 
Round 2(Technical round): 1. Explain each layer of TCP/IP stack 2. What is Http and where is it used in real life 3. Given an array of 1 to n integers with one missing number, find the missing number. 
I answered it using the sum method but then he asked me to given another approach then I told the XOR method. He then asked me to write the code for it. 4. There are 25 horses and 5 tracks, find the minimum number of races need to be conducted 
to find the top 3 fastest horses. 
Round 3(HR round): 1. Tell about your academic and non-academic experiences till btech 2. Where would you see yourself in next 5 years 3. What will you do with your first salary 4. What is your strength and weakness 5. What would your friends tell when asked about you 6. Why not higher studies 
Round 4(Technical round): What is a heap, minheap and maxheap. Time complexity for searching for an element and deleting an element in a heap. Given a minheap, find the maximum number of nodes that are traversed to find the kth smallest element without modifying the heap. Majorly questions were asked from heaps. 
Round 5(HR round): Asked about my family and why I am not interested in higher studies, my hobbies,about my Summer internship. Basically they asked questions to know more about myself. 
The company focused more on technical side. So go through Data structures, OS, DBMS and for coding practice questions from geeksforgeeks and try to code on platforms like Hackerrank.

SUMMER ANALYST- INTERNSHIP
AUTHOR : BHARATH BHUSHAN
 <bharat8apr@gmail.com>
Internship Role: Summer Analyst
Stipend: 1,00,000 INR per month 
Internship Duration: 10 weeks 
Goldman Sachs is one of the highest paying companies that visit our campus.It was the last week of July that we heard that GS will be coming to take interns from NIT-C. The entire selection process consisted of 3 rounds, an online preliminary round, followed by 2 rounds of interviews. 
The preliminary round was conducted in NSL and was hosted on hackerrank platform with a time duration of 2 hours. 
It basically had 2 sections with time limit of 1 hour per section, first section had one coding question(will be described below) and 9 MCQ questions based on Data Structures and Operating Systems. 
The second section had 9 MCQ questions based on Probability, Mathematical Puzzles and few questions related to finance. 
Given a 2D plane and 2 points on it named A and B.Along with them we are also given a set of n points P1, P2, P3,.....Pn. With A and B as centres we can draw 2 circles of radii R1 and R2 respectively. Now we are asked to calculate the values of R1 and R2 such that all N points P1, P2, P3,.....Pn lie inside at least one of the 2 circles, and the value of is minimum - R1 2 + R2 2 
Be perfect with all the basic Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Reviewing basic problems and theorems in probability(like baye’s theorem, conditional probability) will be helpful. 
Be well versed with combinatorics. Many mathematical puzzles will be based on them. 
Around 600+ students gave the test(since there was no restriction on CGPA and Branch). The next day results were announced and 17 students were shortlisted for interviews which were scheduled to be held the following day. 
Interview Rounds: There were 2 interview rounds, both of them were face to face interviews with engineers at GS. 
This round started off with some theoritical questions on OOPs 
What is a Virtual Function? 
What is Inheritance and where did you use it? 
What is Polymorphism and give a real life example where you think polymorphism is used. In fact all these questions were discussed by Vineeth Paleri sir during the end of FOP(Foundations of Programming Course), so big thanks to sir :) 
And then a question on Dynamic programming was asked, it was the famous “EGG DROPPING PUZZLE”. 
 First I was asked to give a recursive solution and then convert it to DP. 
 I was then asked to write down the code on paper and dry run it for few test cases provided by the interviewer. 
 Then I was asked about time and space complexity of recursive and DP solution. 
Then a series of questions were asked from basic Data Structures. 
 Reverse a Linked List without using extra space and in linear time. 
 You are being given a continuous stream numbers, at any instance you are asked to print the k maximum elements among the numbers received uptil that instance. 
 I proposed a solution using min heap of size k. 
 I was asked to write the code on paper and explain it. 
Then as expected, I was asked to derive it’s time complexity. 
And then it was followed by few questions on DBMS. 
 What is difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. 
Give an example of NoSQL database. 
I was then asked about my Internship experience at IIT-Bombay, which I attended during summers after 2nd year.We had a nice little chat on the project which I worked on during my Internship, and about the technologies used in it. 
That was the end of first round and 5 students were qualified for second round. 
 Most of the questions were based on basic Data Structures, so just revise everything covered in DSA course. 
 Learn Dynamic Programming well. 
 Doing Competitive Coding helped a lot. 
 Look into basic concepts of OOPs. 
 As soon as I entered the room, I was asked to solve an algorithmic question. 
Given a sorted array which is rotated by k places in clockwise direction, find the value of k in most optimal way.(I gave a solution similar to binary search which takes O(log n)) 
Write recurrence relation for above solution. 
Solve the recurrence using Master’s Theorem and recurrence tree method and show that they will give same result. 
Then he asked me few questions on campus life and current academic curriculum and asked me whether I was satisfied with it. 
I said I’m not satisfied with our curriculum :P, and the reason for that is first year.(wasting a lot of time on irrelevant courses and workshops) 
Then we spoke about my Internship at IIT-Bombay, challenges that I faced there and how I overcame them. 
Now again he switched back to technical questions. 
What is your favourite Data Structure?(I said Graphs) 
Why Graphs? 
Which Data Structure would you use to implement a dictionary?(Trie) 
What is the time complexity to retrieve a word of length M using trie. 
Then he gave a real life situation and asked me to give a solution to it. 
You are given a mini-world where there are only self driving cars, how would design a system for interaction between Traffic signal and car such that traffic rules are followed, i.e. car stops when traffic signal is red, slows down upon yellow and so on. 
First I proposed a solution where the system associated with the car keeps sending signals to the system associated with traffic signal at regular intervals of time(Polling) to check it’s status and then act accordingly. 
He accepted it and then asked me questions on polling, like what is the difference between long polling and polling? 
But I immediately realised that it is not the most optimal solution, since there will be many useless signals sent to system associated with traffic signal(hence wastage of resources). 
Then I said him a solution using WebSockets, which maintains a continuous pipelined connection with the server, hence consumes less resources and he was satisfied. 
It ended with few basic HR questions like 
 What are you expecting to learn at GS. 
 How did you get to know about GS. 
 If you are working in a team where one of your team member is not productive, as a team leader what would you do? 
 At the end he asked if i had any questions. I asked a couple of questions regarding how interns work there and also about GS work culture. 
That was the end of Interviews. We got results on the same day and 3 of us made it through. 
I hope my experiences help you to be better prepared for your Internship Opportunities.
All the Best !

CGPA cutoff – No cutoff
Stipend – 1 Lakh
Although there was no official cutoff for the CGPA, I believe it is taken into consideration. Most of us who were shortlisted for the interviews had a CGPA >= 9. (Although this could also mean that those with a higher CGPA simply did better too).
I’ve heard people say that CGPA isn’t important, and while that may be true to some extent, if you aren’t extremely talented in another area, or have prior work experience or have some other way to display your talent, CGPA might well be an important factor.
The online round was pretty typical of what I expected from GS. They asked one coding question and there were 2 sections. One section was devoted to CS and the other section was devoted to logical / mathematical questions. 
The coding question was a problem based on geometry. My solution was based on some heuristics, but it managed to pass 80% of the test cases. My advice for solving coding questions would be to practice. I had been programming for about a year pretty consistently so I was pretty confident of my ability to solve whatever question that was asked.
The CS questions were pretty straightforward and anyone who has paid attention in class (particularly DSA) shouldn’t find them too challenging. 
The next section was logical / mathematical in nature. If you’re good in probability it is an advantage. Take your Discrete Structures course seriously, you will learn how to do some basic probability questions there. Competitive Programming can help here too. Some problems require knowledge of techniques in probability so if you’ve done questions of that sort, it can help you here.
About 20 of us were shortlisted for the interview round. To my surprise there were only 2 interview rounds. They managed to cut the list of prospective candidates by more than 70% after one interview round. 
My first-round interviewer was an NITC alumnus. He was extremely cordial and we started off with a simple (in my opinion) question. The question was related to the usage of a trie. Since I had been programming for a while at this point, this was a non-issue for me. We then did a simple probability question. I had listed my profile on Codechef in my resume and he had noted it. He was pretty impressed and told me that he wouldn’t ask me any coding questions since I was likely to solve them. He asked me about my favourite data structure and I replied with (in my opinion one of the coolest data structures I know) the “Segment Tree”. I then explained to him how it works and we discussed some uses for it. We then moved onto a bunch of puzzles all of which are pretty simple. He then asked me about my interests and I told him what they were. We then had a discussion about my interests (which are mostly AI in this discussion). He asked me some people – management questions and some basic questions on time complexity and then asked me if I had any questions. I asked him some questions and then we were done.
We were all made to wait for the results and it turned it that only 5 remained after the 1st round of interviews.
For Round 2 the interviewer started off by asking me about my resume. I walked him through some of the volunteer work I had done (I had volunteered for the World Scholar’s Cup And also the Round Square Conference before). He then asked me why I solve questions (probably since he saw that I was an avid competitive programmer). I gave an answer and he seemed pretty satisfied (maybe even a little surprised?) with my answer. We then had a coding question for which I took some time to come up with a solution. However, it wasn’t the solution with the best complexity. The question asked about the number of squares that can be formed in a plane with n given points. I had attempted to use a line sweep with a BST but it turned out that there was a much simpler solution. I believe that he was trying to gauge my thinking process rather than the actual solution. So, I would say it is imperative that you think out loud. I had listed Chess as one of my hobbies. He then asked me how many squares were on a chessboard. I blurted out 64 but then realized that he wanted the total number of squares (and not the number of primitive squares). So, I did that and he then asked me about my proficiency in C++. I told him I rated myself (9 / 10) and he proceeded to ask me some questions. He asked me about “pure functions” which I had never heard of, but I told him I could guess as to what they were and it turned out I was right. He then asked me if I had any questions and after my questions, we were done.
We were again made to wait for the results and it turned out they had shortlisted 3 of us for the internship. 
CGPA is more important than you think. (Some companies even have a cut – off).
Write your resume so that it plays to your strengths. (You needn’t be able to do everything, you just need to do a few things better than anyone else).
If you are a CS student it is imperative that you can program and solve problems. (Competitive programming can really help you here. If you enjoy it, then it’s a no-brainer to do it and get better at it).
It also helps to have a few personal projects. It shows that you have genuine interest in a few fields and are capable of taking on some work and completing it purely because you’re interested. (Of course, this is assuming that you’re doing it out of interest).
It would also probably be beneficial to have a prior internship experience. This isn’t a necessity, but it would help you stand out from the rest of the pack. (The 2nd years can thus work on some personal projects, or do an internship or work on improving their programming ability in their summer).
Aside from my academic work, I had been involved in sports, quizzing and a host of other activities and I had listed some of them on my resume. This would show that you are a well-rounded individual capable of doing more than memorizing information from a book. I believe that this would also give you an edge. So, do not immerse yourself only in academics. Do your academics well and also try to spend time doing other work, such as debating or sports or anything else that you might be passionate about.
Well that’s it from me. All the best for all you prospective students!

EDISON ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
AUTHOR : ARCHANA NARAYANAN
< archana7950@gmail.com >
GE was the 5th or 6th company that came for us. CS students were taken into GE healthcare while GE power, transportation etc. were open to other branch students.
The initial test was an aptitude+coding test on AMCAT platform that consisted of MCQs and 2 coding questions.
10 students were shortlisted from BTech out of which 8 went for the interviews.
The selection process started in the morning with a group discussion. We had 3-5 minutes time to discuss on the topic 'the rise of artificial intelligence: is it a boon or bane to humanity'.
Do try to keep the conversation going on if you're participating in a GD. Do not hesitate to put forward your point. Even if you feel like you're not getting a chance to speak away, politely try to be in the flow and make sure that you speak.
5 students cleared the GD and had another 3 rounds of interviews. In the technical round, they mainly concentrated on my resume, my internship and the projects done. They asked me a few DSA questions like loop in a linked list and some tree manipulations. There were a few puzzles and so many behavioral questions. On the technical front, he also asked me about multithreading in python because I had told that I was comfortable with Python.
The first round was around an hour long.
The second round was a managerial round, where he asked me questions like the top 3 companies I had in my mind, what do I wish to pursue in my career, my ambitions and goals. We also had an open discussion on the work culture at GE and he showed me a glimpse of how Edison program will be like, on my request.
The third round was as HR round and he asked me every non tech question that could be asked out of a person's resume. Favorite project and why ! Why did I do something and why did I prefer something over the other. He gave me scenarios and asked for my takes on that. This was a detailed discussion and must have lasted another hour.
All 5 of us went through all the rounds and it was past 9 by the time they finished the process.
They announced the results at 10 and 2 of us from Btech got selected.
GE specific tip: Make sure that you have lots and lots to talk about. Be it about the projects or your hobbies or ambitions ! Think out loud and talk it out :) All the very best !

CGPA cutoff - 7.5
Online coding test -
 The online test had a combination of MCQs as well as a few coding problems. The MCQs were on various topics in Computer Science such as DBMS, CN, OS, most of which are covered during the course. 
Number of rounds in the interview - 
There were 3 rounds of interview. The first round was a technical round, the second round was called (by the interviewers) a Project Manager round and the third round was a HR round. 
Sample questions in each round:
First Round Questions - 
Basic questions on C/C++ to gauge your understanding on how these programming languages work such as what steps take place between compiling and executing code.
There were also questions on basic coding problems on arrays such as sorting.
Questions about projects were asked such as give an overview of your project, draw a diagram to represent your project, explain ER diagrams and so on. Few questions were also posed on the group dynamics within the project team and your role in the project.
Second Round Questions - 
Most of the questions asked in this round were scenario based. You would be given a scenario such as if there are disagreements between you and other team members, how would you resolve it, what are your strengths and weaknesses, how are you at communicating with people, how would you describe yourself as a person and so on.
There were also some standard questions such as where do you see yourself in five years, what do you aim to achieve by joining the company. 
Third Round Questions - 
Questions were based on what was written in your resume such as courses that you took, extra-curricular activities, what soft skills you have and other basic info on your resume.
There were also questions about group dynamics in project teams again, how problems were solved, how disputes in ideology were solved, whether you took on a leadership role or not, what would you have done differently if given a chance.
Questions such as why should we hire you and why are you interested to join the company were also asked.
Position and stipend - 
The position was a post in the Edison Engineering Development Programme (EEDP) and the CTC being offered was 15.3 LPA for UG CS and 16.3 LPA for PG CS.
Preparation tips - 
Go through basic concepts and brush up on the subjects that were mentioned in the online coding test. Be prepared to answer questions on anything that you have written in your resume. Think about your own answers for the questions that are asked in the second and third round. Also don’t get flustered while answering question. Think about your answers carefully and only then speak.
Number of people taken - 
2 students from UG CS and 1 student from PG CS
How was the interview process? 
The interview experience was pretty good overall. The first two interviewers were pretty jovial and spoke quite casually and so created a good atmosphere for the interview. The last interviewer was quite serious most of his questions were put across in an intense manner. 
How many rounds were there? Were they all technical?
There were 3 rounds. Only the first one was technical.
How was the questions in each round? Were they focusing on any technology or concept?
The questions in each round were of a moderate level and could be answered if you have prepared well for the interview process. They did not focus on any technology as such. Most questions were asked in a general manner. 
How did you prepare for the test? Do you think you should do something differently or focus on something specific during preparation?
I prepared for the MCQ part of the online coding test by going through the Last Minute Notes that are available for the various subjects on www.geeksforgeeks.org. The coding questions were quite generic and can be found on most online competitive coding sites.

It had 3 sections. Each had a time limit.
1.Basic Aptitude
2.Computer Science Fundamentals(DSA, C, DBMS, OS).
3.Technology Section(Based on Web technologies).
--->In Aptitude Section,few questions were easy and rest of them were not tough but moderate(takes little longer).
--->Computer Science Fundamentals were kind of easy and scoring.
     =>Questions were from 
                  1.Time Complexity
                  2.Operations of Stack,linked list.
                  3.Scheduling in OS.
                  4.Input-Output related questions(C)  
--->Third section was quite different.But many of them can be answered intuitively.(DO NOT LEAVE IF U HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE. JUST GIVE IT A TRY).
Around 13 students were shortlisted.
It was only a one round Interview (both Technical & HR interviewers were there).
-->Tell me about yourself?
-->What are your Interests? I said DSA and OS.
-->What is meant by Inter-Process Communication? How do you do that? Why do we need that? 
     I answered them but they doesn't seem to be convinced.
     Then I have taken an example and elucidated clearly(Any of the technique would suffice.I have chosen Semaphores).
     Asked few questions on semaphores(basic).
-->Tell me about your projects.
     I had taken OS lab.Since I was doing that time I could answer them with ease.(You need to be thorough to answer any minute detail of the project).
-->Do you use Whatsapp? Seems funny right :) Yes was my answer.
-->What Data Structures you know? Ans: Array,Linked List,Stack,Queue,Trees.
-->Making use of given data structures,can you design Whatsapp? 
   My Answer: Each message can be stored in a Array(String). For each message,any members can reply to that message.
      I came up with a n-array tree where each node consisting of text message,and links to children(reply to this message function).
          For each subsequent child node down the tree.Each message can have a reply.And each reply can have a reply so a tree would do this perfectly.
          Then little discussion on message queues and stacks.It went on for a while.Finally they were happy with my approach.
-->What do you know about Ford IT?
-->Why do you want to join our firm?
-->Where do you see yourself after few yrs? 
Then I asked a few questions.
-->What kind of work do you expect a fresher to do?  
-->What kinds of projects are available for interns?
Finally 4 were selected for Internship at Ford IT Chennai. Fortunately,I was one among them.

There were four rounds in total - online test, group discussion, technical interview and HR interview.
The online test consists of mainly two section, the aptitude part and the technical part. The aptitude part had 60 questions in total for 60 minutes. It had three subparts - verbal, logical and analytical, and quantitative. Technical part had 30 questions for 30 minutes. The questions were mainly on thermodynamics and fluid mechanics, but there were other topics too.
Group discussion had very general topics, everyone will be able to give their inputs. Some of the topics were "how can Indian movies win more international awards", "bullet trains", "should India send people to space", etc. The topics do not repeat usually, but they're such that everyone can pitch in their ideas. What matters during group discussion is that you stay polite and do not interrupt anyone when they're speaking. We need to keep in mind that it is a discussion and not a debate. Creativity is appreciated; giving points which are very unique adds points. Irrelevance and stating false facts will definitely reduce one's scores.
Technical interview was mostly about the internships and projects done. There were conceptual questions too from the core theory subjects. The candidate will be asked for his or her favorite subjects, and then asked questions from the same.
HR interview majorly followed the STAR rule - situation, task, action, result.
For the online test, I prepared from indiabix and pariksha.com. Time is a big deal. One should practice enough to make sure that he/she is able to solve questions really quick. Speed matters the most.
The company is one of the biggest oil and gas processing company in the world. Job profile was core for all the branches. The job location for us is Bangalore. The recruiters are very friendly and believe that people perform the best when not under stress.

We had two rounds. A gd and then a technical + HR round combined
The topics for GD were quite easy N had a vast scope to speak about them. If you are good with your facts and statistics then that shall add on to your marks.
Technical + HR round included some basic questions on my favorite subject that I opted as power electronics out of power electronics, machines and power systems, and many HR questions like strengths, weaknesses, interpersonal skills etc.
For technical round a brief knowledge of subjects is necessary as in depth questions are not asked. They just cover the entire syllabus with direct questions.
For HR, you need to have good communication skills and be prepared with some basic answers like strengths and weaknesses. I was given certain job situations and day to day situations and asked to react on it and give logic, so presence of mind is also important.
In all ExxonMobil is a great opportunity for those who are a combination of both, technical knowledge and an active co curricular side, coz they do talk about your hobbies and what you do in 4 yrs of your college life, rather than just sticking to theoretical knowledge.

I was shortlisted for interview solely based on my resume. There wasn't any test conducted. 
There was only one round of interview. The interview was telephonic and lasted for about 30 minutes. At first, the interviewer asked me to talk about myself . He then scanned through my resume and asked questions based on that. I was asked to explain all my projects in detail. There were also questions based on DBMS,MySQL and PHP. 
Knowledge of any MVC frameworks was also enquired. I had only a very basic knowledge of Ruby on Rails. 
Overall, the interviewer was pretty cool and supportive.

I got placed in Dell for the Software Engineer post .
There were 3 rounds in total-2 technical and 1 HR.
The first round for me was more about my resume.Be well prepared to answer questions on your project.Some questions on SQL and ER diagrams were also asked.Basic knowledge on data structures like stacks,trees was also tested.For eg,the interviewer gave me some basic tree traversal problem.This was pretty much the first round. 
The next round was more of a general discussion round.One's thinking process is evaluated here.He asked all sorts of questions from 12th std physics to data structures.More value is given to the idea than the correct answer. 
The third round was HR.Nothing much was asked other than location preference and other details.
The interview process is more or less the same as other companies. No additional preparation is needed. 
Just like everyone else would advise-be confident and try your best.Even if you don't know the correct answer,try to get to it.Do your homework on the company before attending the interview.Knowing absolutely nothing about the company sets a bad impression.
Lastly,do not be disheartened if you don't get a job in the first few companies or in your dream company.Dell was the 9th interview I attended.So just prepare well and give your best shot. All the best!

The interview process comprised of three rounds, technical, managerial and hr. 
The technical round started with self introduction and was followed by Internship project details. It's highly necessary that one knows his/her project thoroughly along with the frameworks and languages used. There will be coding questions in the languages known to you. Specific basic coding questions like prime or not and puzzles like the cake cutting were asked. Data storage techniques, SQL queries were also covered in the questions. 
Managerial round composed of various real life scenarios and challenging situations thrown at the student. How one tactfully and easily tackles the problem is evaluated here. They want to know more about the extra curriculars and the life lessons that you've learnt. Interviewer also had questions on how to improve coding and a software solution. The interviewer expects the student to confidently state why he/she chose the company and how the student can be the right person to contribute to the growth of the company. They also enquire about the students favourite topic/field.

The interview process consisted of 4 rounds.The first 3 rounds were technical cum managerial,and the fourth was the HR round.
The first round was pretty chill-he asked us questions to basically test our spontaneity in answering them.He didn’t care if the answers were correct.The second round was better:I got to have a discussion with the interviewer on topics like information security and cryptography.He was just trying to see how much interest I have in this field.It pretty much depends on what you say you know,and whatever the interviewer asks will depend on that.Since I talked about cryptography,we discussed a few things on that.
In the next round,there were questions on how you can secure a website,what kind of threats/attacks you would expect to happen,how would you take care of the issues you just mentioned and so on. Basic questions on firewalls,network security and things like sql injections,fortified scanning etc.were asked.In the end,he asked me if I had any idea for a project I’d like to implement,if I get selected.It’d be good to have an idea ready in hand before the interview:since the position would be mentioned beforehand,you could maybe think of something and hence have a better answer rather than thinking up one in the spot.
The last round was the HR round.I was asked about my hobbies,interests etc. I had taken the course Number Theory and Cryptography as an elective,so I had some basic knowledge on cryptography.I had also read up as much as I could on computer security and networks,which helped a lot.Basically your interest matters.Whatever internship position you’re interviewing for,having a pet project or something of the sort that suits it would definitely impress the interviewer.Read up on the company and have a good understanding of the kind of work there:This is important.Even if you don’t do that,there’s the ppt session,where you can get an overall idea about the company.But I’d advise you to do your research beforehand.Finally,during the interview,be calm and confident.

AUTHOR : SHRUTI NAIR 
CGPA cut-off was 6 if I remember correctly
Online round: There were three sections comprising of quantitative aptitude, logical, and verbal aptitude. They were fine, just make sure not to make careless errors.
Number of rounds in the interview: 2.
One JAM round, and then one round of interviews.
Sample questions in each round:
For the first round, practice as many aptitude problems as you can find and learn the short cuts.
Topics present in the JAM round were technical for the most part. You can refer to GeeksforGeeks for sample topics. Make sure you’re knowledgeable in these areas, and practice speaking  in front of people with confidence. Make your points clear and concise. 
For the interview, I was mostly asked questions based on my resume. He asked me to talk about my summer internship and asked questions based on it. I told him my area of interest was machine learning, and he asked me how machine learning has transformed the industry. He also asked me to explain the impact of my favorite tech giant. He asked a couple of basic technical questions based on CSE, and then continued to go through my resume. He questioned me on a bit of general knowledge and a quick math round since my resume mentioned winning a GK-based competition in school, so make sure you are thorough with whatever you’ve written on your resume, no matter how old it is. 
Stipend: 6.7 lakhs
Preparation tips:
It really helps if you’ve done an internship. Deloitte is more focussed on what actual work you’ve done as compared to GPA, so if not an internship, try to mention some good projects.
It is also important to keep in mind that Deloitte values strong communication skills, so make sure to work on confidence and articulation.
Number of people taken:
From Computer Science, one. In total, across all branches, around 16.

Deloitte had come to our Campus  during the second week of November. They hired both full-timers and interns. I was among the interns. The internship process began with a test that was conducted few days prior to the interview. 
The questions were from three different sections : Verbal Ability, Aptitude and Logic and some Mathematical questions. They shortlisted around 14 candidates from the whole lot for the next rounds. The next rounds included JAM(Just A Minute) and an interview with one of the panel members. We were given a Pre-Placement Talk before our Jam which was amazing considering the fact that they managed to get the crowd interactive unlike most other companies that had come. The panel was very active. Their presentation was also informative. 
Then we were taken for JAM in which we were divided into groups and was assigned a JAM Master from their panel members. Our JAM master was a friendly guy and listened keenly to each one of us speak.
Some of the topics they had asked for JAM are :
1) The downside of Technology
2) Can India become a Manufacturing Power
3) How can we leverage technology to combat climate change
4) One tech company that has a big impact in your life
5) Life as a Robot
and other similar topics related to technology and the current trends.
Out of the 14 they shortlisted 6 students for the next round which was going to be the final interview. The interviewer scanned through my Resume thoroughly and asked about the project I had done, he asked about the technical difficulties I had faced while doing it and asked me to explain them.He also asked about my reason for choosing Deloitte, my goal in life and also about how do I plan to implement the things that I want to achieve.He also asked some questions from my areas of interest.
He asked if I had questions for him, to which I asked about the things I wanted to know.
In short, it was a great experience being with a very friendly team from Deloitte. All the members of the team that had come to our college were interesting people with a lot of positive vibe in them.
Tips to all friends attending Placement Interviews:
1) Your composure is a very important factor for any interview. Be pleasant no matter what.
2) Should be good at speaking ,naturally most of us are but make sure you stay confident even among people whom you have not met before.
3) Stay formal , being a consulting company I would say that one must be polite and be formal in all the talkings done.
4) Last but not the least, every organisation has their own ideologies. So do a good research if you are in for the second round and make sure your interests match with theirs ( else don't attend the written test 'coz you might be taking away some deserving person's opportunity , might seem trivial but important)

Number of rounds-2
Round-1: was a test of oratory skills through a one minute extempore. Thirty seconds for preparing the content after topic was announced, one minute of speaking time. Topics were technology related and judgement was more focused on delivery than on content. 
Round-2: technical+HR. This round was for the major part based on the projects mentioned in the resume. A thorough questioning of what the project was and how the project was completed. Very basic technical questions. 
A thorough understanding of everything mentioned in the resume is required. A look through the topics given in the previous years is very helpful for the speaking round.

Cisco visited our campus for both full timers and interns during the last week of August. UG and PG of CSE and ECE were allowed to sit for the test.
This was an online MCQ test. Most questions were from aptitude which are generally easy to score. It's better to familiarise some of the common aptitude questions which can be found here (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/placements-gq/). Questions from DBMS, OS, OOPS concept,  Networks and Digital Logic were asked along with some topics from ECE. Some questions were about error detection and output prediction from a given C++ or Java code. There was no coding round.
Cisco had three profile: Application, Network and System. We can give our preference but interviewers will sort us to any of the three profile based on our performance. Number of rounds were not same for everyone. 
This was a technical round. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself while he went through my resume. He asked me about my internship experience and the projects I have done.
After the discussion was a coding question, to find the intersection point of two linked lists. 
Solution: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-function-to-get-the-intersection-point-of-two-linked-lists
Make sure you communicate your approach and ask questions while solving. I found the optimal algorithm and was asked to write code for it in pseudo code or any language I prefer. You just have to write the function and do remember to clearly state any assumption you made.
Other questions asked were:
How will we store large set of phone numbers and owner info? I answered hash table. 
How hash tables are implemented? Its complexity. Example of a hash function.
What are sockets? Why do we use them?
What is localhost?
What is DNS? What are its uses?
What is interprocess communication?
What is a process? Why do we need them?
I struggled a bit while answering few of them. He then asked me about my final year project. It was related computer security and he was interested in knowing more. We had an in depth discussion about it. The round was about 50 minutes.
This was more like a technical plus HR round. We had a brief discussion about my internship project. He asked me about my interest and why I rejected the PPO from my internship. He asked me how active I am in github after seeing my github link in the resume. He then asked me about my dream company (I wasn’t allowed to answer Cisco), my ambition in life, my background and about an achievement I mentioned in my resume.
This was the HR round. It only lasted for 5 minutes contrary to other companies. Questions were:
Tell me about yourself
Why Cisco?
What do you like to improve in yourself?
What are your preferred locations?
In all interviews the interviewer will give you an opportunity to ask questions to them. It is advisable to ask something, maybe about the company, their experience in the company or your doubts. The interviewers were friendly and first two interviewers were NITC alumni. All selected were given a T-shirt and a pen drive :)

<praj12121998@gmail.com>
The first round was an online test which had only MCQ. There were 50 MCQ to be solved in 1 hour. The questions were on aptitude, Data Structure, Operating System, Networks , OOPs. The questions were of intermediate difficulty but you need to be really quick to solve them as 1 hour won’t be enough to solve all of them. Try to solve those questions which you know. As there was no negative marking its better you check all the answers. 
25 students were selected for the 2nd round of technical interview. 
The interviewer started with ‘Tell me about yourself?’ He wanted to know my interest. I told him that I liked development and then we had a talk. He gave me some situation And asked me to come up with a solution (How will you build a software for it?). I told him some ideas but there was a lot to add to it and so he extended those ideas by adding many important points. Basically he need you to be confident and express your views, the interviewer helps you out to think. He also asked me what is binary sort to which I replied that I have not heard about it and told him all other type of sorting algorithms.. He just wanted to check my confidence on this. Then he asked me two coding questions on Trees. 
1. Insert in Binary Tree(Use Level Order Traversal) 
2. ZigZag Tree Traversal 
He first listened to my approach and then told to write it on a paper. They want full code to be written and not just the algorithm. So you should be well prepared for writing the code. 
This round started with ‘What is your favourite programming language?’(C). He asked me some theory questions. He then wrote a piece of code on paper and told me to predict the output. The questions was on pointers and wanted to check my knowledge on that. He asked me more output questions which really checked my basics. 
You should be clear with your basics and be confident when you answer them. 
He asked me some questions like 
1. Tell me about yourself
2. What are your future goals? 
Finally 6 students were selected for the Internship

There are 3 types of CGPA cut off-  7.5, 7, 6.5
If >7.5 you'll attend 98% of the companies, >7 70% of the companies,
In the beginning it's always 7 or 7.5
Main topics asked in priority order were- DS, ALGOS, OOPS, DBMS, OS.
Mostly they test your coding skills. Sometimes Classic DP questions like LCS etc. Sometimes normal questions with no algorithm( linked list mostly)
Interview consisted of  3 rounds - mostly 2-technical and 1 HR
Sometimes 4- 3- technical and 1 HR(big companies)
Post is Software Engineer ( BigBasket) and pay package is 9L per annum
They selected 3 people.
Tips- Utilise holidays fully, to the maximum. Please try to get interviewed every day by someone, please code everyday, first learn most important things, then learn less important things
Online test + 2 interview rounds
Both interview rounds were on the phone. 
Interviewer was friendly and I wasn’t nervous at all in the interview. 
Tell me about yourself?
Step by step code to number of zeros in a factorial in C without using any math library functions. The interviewer and I communicated through a code-sharing platform.
Step by step code to power of an integer in C without using any math library functions. We also had a discussion on how we could write the code recursively/top-down approach.
Interviewer was asking me why I wrote that line of code to make sure what I was doing and I didn't just mug it up.
In this process, whenever the code isn't working, interviewer asked me to check my code. I quickly pointed out my own mistakes I wrote in the code and fixed them.
Interviewer seemed to check my coding, thinking and debugging skills.
Asked me what languages I knew, asked if I knew Java and discussion about projects
Asked me specific functionalities in my project, like Eg: why would you implement that? What can you improve in the project? What was your role? How would you implement this feature in your project? 
Tell me about the projects you’ve done?
We had a discussion on my projects
Asked about higher studies(obviously said no)
Why do you want to work for our company? What do you think makes our company special/ successful? 
I did my research about the company and asked him some good questions and he was explaining them to me.
My suggestion is to ask the interviewer at least 3 questions, 1 about the work, the other 2 anything, if you can 
Eg: What would be the biggest project your company would be working on in the next 2 years?
What kind of team will I be working with, when I join the company?
A lot of interviewers ask about data structures, 
Try to finish all the important algorithms and problems in DS and Algorithms-Karumanchi book..
Next most important is DBMS basics(DBMS > OS)
Be familiar with all the interview experiences in geeksforgeeks.

My story of how I got into Bajaj Auto-Aug 1, 2018
First there will be a preliminary online written test through which they shortlist 8 candidates (normal trend) for the interview rounds. The results of the test are announced either on the very day of the interview (as in this year) or the night before the interview day (as in last year). The interview rounds consist of two levels of technical rounds followed by a HR (Human Resource) round after which their final list of selection is announced.
The preliminary online written test consist of 90 questions to be completed in 90 minutes. There is a technical half (45 questions) and an aptitude half (45 questions). The technical half this year consisted of MCQs largely from Machine design, Fluid Mechanics and Automobiles with traces of Manufacturing, Material Sciences and Solid Mechanics. I prepared for the technical half by reading Gate material (I used those of ACE) available on each core subject starting from S3. You simply need to skim through the topics and get a general understanding of it by getting exposed to keywords and concepts. Regarding the Aptitude half which was split into Language, Logical Reasoning and Quantitative, I was able to do quite well. I could save lots of time in quantitative as I had practised sufficiently, prior to the test. Language and logical reasoning were quite simple and they are areas where you can accelerate and save considerable time to think at the technical half.
The Bajaj interview this year was a tedious process starting from 11.30 am in the morning and ending at 7.30 pm at night. I had to skip lunch and wait at TnP for 8 long hours. In 8 hours I was interviewed for 2.5 hours considering all 3 rounds. The first round was a technical round which lasted up to 1.5 hours for me. They asked me questions starting from first year engineering graphics, from where they covered almost all the core topics from S3 till S6. Majority of the questions were about Drawings, Manufacturing science and methods, and Material Science. They also touched almost every topics that we were taught in the previous semesters. The second technical round questioned me about my favourite subjects. I had opted for Thermal, Automobile and Hydraulics. It lasted for half an hour and in the end I was sent to the HR panel. The HR round lasted for another half an hour. It was the most interesting and enjoyable round of the interview. The HR will question us about our personality, why we opted for their company and what our skills apart from academics are.  
Your CGPA has very limited role in the selection procedure. It only accounts for your eligibility to attend the test. Try to practice Quantitative aptitude questions daily and improve your performance by doing time tests. Also do try to cover all core subjects starting from S3. Concepts are very important especially for the interview. And during the Interview try to maintain a pleasant atmosphere and keep smiling and try to make them smile because in the end impression always matters.

The first round was a test.
Around 10-15 people were selected after the test.
After that there were 2 rounds of technical interviews followed by a HR round.
First Question : Given an array of integer of size n. Find if any number repeats more than n/2 times. (The majority element question) Answer with order of n was expected
Second Question : Suppose there are two singly linked lists, both of which intersect at some point and become a single linked list. Head pointers of both the linked lists are known. FInd the node where the lists intersect.  (Linked list)
Third Question : A sorting algorithm
This round went well for me as I could answer all these questions
I was asked 3 puzzles and 2 simple coding questions. Puzzles required a logical thinking.
All the rounds were chill. It wasn’t very difficult. The HR round had some basic questions.
3 qualified the technical rounds and after the HR round, 2 were selected.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN
AUTHOR : VISAKH S
Two rounds - 1 written test, 1 technical interview
Consisted of 23 mcq questions and 2 coding questions. The mcqs were easy and mostly based on data structures, C, and database theory.  Both coding questions were also easy although one was thought provoking. There were no negative marking and more weightage was for coding questions. Five of us were selected to the next round.
Both the test questions were discussed again during the interview. So i suggest you to learn understand the test problems and their optimal solutions before the interview, even if u couldn’t solve them during the first stage since there is a chance of being asked about it again as it happened with some of my friends too.
They mostly asked me about web development concepts ( one was what is overflow in css, i don’t remember the rest of them). I was also given another problem and was asked to optimise it further. Optimisation is one question most interviewers like to ask, and it is important to answer them in confidence even if you can’t think of any more optimal solution(it is debatable but the general idea is that confidence matters), sometimes there won’t be anymore optimisations possible and the interviewer might be testing your ability to say find that out and say no. You can find some interesting approaches to solve a coding problem during an interview in Gayle Laakmann’s  “Cracking the Coding Interview”. 
Three of us were selected as interns after this round.

CGPA Cutoff: 8 
Monthly Stipend: 45,000 INR 
Internship Duration: 10 weeks 
Other benefits: 50,000 INR (One time relocation bonus). 
There were two rounds, an online coding round, followed by telephone Interview. 
The test was conducted on Hackerrank Platform and we were given 3 coding questions to be solved in 90 minutes. 
Q1. Based on Insert and search on trie. Just,we need to complete the Insert function portion and remaining portion of code was already given(non-editable). https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trie-insert-and-search/ 
Q2. Find the maximum sum from root to a leaf node of a given n-ary tree. 
Q3. This Question was a little lengthy which i don’t remember exactly, and it took me a lot of time to understand. It was based on structures and Linked list of linked lists. Given a linked list where each node contains a structure(say type-1) and one of its attribute points to another linked list where each node contains a structure(say type-2), and we need to sort the linked list based on some key in structure(type-1) at the same time sort the linked list connected to each node based on some key in structure(type-2). 
[these structure types(type-1 and type-2) and function to sort a linked list are given in code(non-editable), and we need to complete logic of given function by using given code(mainly sort function)]. 
One can found questions like Q1 and Q3 type which requires us to complete some function on Hackerrank.Practicing a few will be helpful. 
Three of us were shortlisted for Interview round. 
It was a telephonic interview. Interview happened at the same time for all of us in Tnp centre (in different rooms). Questions are basic and mainly focuses on our understanding and confidence. 
I received a call from my Interviewer and he shared me a link for a kind of real time code sharing platform (like codeshare.io , I don’t remember exactly), which i have to open in my laptop. For some questions he gave me pseudo code and asked questions on that code, And for some i have to write code. 
1. He gave small C code on pointers, and asked many questions like how to pass as arguments, where are they stored in memory, scope, etc., I answered most of the questions using memory layout concept. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-layout-of-c-program/ 
2. I was asked to write a working code to Print evenly repeating characters in a string (easy) .
3. Size of the structure containing char, int, float, double types (tricky -- concept of data Alignment and padding). 
4. He then asked me to suggest a data structure for Vehicle registration system,where we have to store the information regarding vehicle like date of registration, owner, vehicle-type(like 2 wheeler,4 wheeler ),vehicle number,etc., such a way that it supports following queries 
given two dates as input, details of all vehicles registered between those dates should be output. 
given vehicle-type as input, details of all vehicles of that type should be output. 
given vehicle number as input, details of that vehicle should be output. 
It’s important to understand the question and clarify doubts if any,before answering.[I suggested Multidimensional array with Linked list implementation, it sounds he was satisfied with my approach.] 
My Interviewer was quite chill and he made me feel comfortable by giving feedback in between. Finally he asked if i had any questions, I asked a couple of questions regarding their work culture and technologies i found on company’s website. 
No HR Interview .That was the end of Interview, we got results on next day and 2 of us were selected for Internship.

For vehicle type as input, details of all vehicles of that type should be output.
If we give two dates as input, details of all vehicles registered between those dates should be output.
She wanted to know the time and space complexity of all my solutions.
5. Questions on memory layout of C (where are pointers, automatic variables stored ? etc)
Finally, she asked me if I had any questions for her. I asked a few questions.
After two rounds two people were selected for internship.
Study DSA and time, space complexities.

The interview process comprised of 4 rounds (3 technical + 1 HR). Round 1 was fairly easy, the interviewer mainly asked questions related to common algorithms (like merge sort) and data structures (like stack and queue). Some candidates were asked questions like reversing a linked list, printing values at even numbered nodes in a linked list, implementing stack using queue etc. More than half the people who were interviewed cleared this round.
The second round was based on the candidate's CV. The interviewer started this round by asking questions related to the projects given in the CV. He also browsed through my github repositories. After this he started asking solutions for some puzzles (like towers of hanoi, two water jug puzzle etc). The interviewer also asked how one could implement a URL shortner.
In the third technical round candidates were asked to design a solution for problem. The problem given to me was to design a queue and counter system at a bank given some constraints like working time of the bank, time taken by each customer etc. 
The final round was an HR round where interviewer asked questions regarding my family, hobbies, dislikes etc.
Overall the interview process was stress-free and easy going. Reading interview experiences and topic wise interview preparation section from geeksforgeeks would be the best way to prepare as almost all the questions asked for the first and second round were questions present in geeksforgeeks.

I was selected for an internship at Cisco AppDynamics.First we had an online screening test. Then we had two rounds of interviews. The interview was through the WebX platform.
The first round was almost fully technical and my knowledge of data structures and algorithms was tested. 
The second round was a mix of technical and HR questions. There were a lot of questions on object oriented programming concepts.
The HR questions were pretty straightforward. From my experience, a sound knowledge of DSA and OOPs concepts could get you through. They seemed to be interested in the depth of my knowledge in Java.

5 rounds – 1 Online examination, 3 Rounds of Technical Interview, 1 Round HR Interview
The first round had 20 Aptitude MCQs (20 min) and 15 Technical MCQs (15 min) with +1 and -0.25 marking schemes. The MCQs covered topics the included – DSA, Operating Systems, C, C++, Java basics. After this, there were 2 coding questions (45 min). Minimum cut off was set for each section. First question was an moderately difficult question and the second one was a bit difficult.
Those who could solve at least one question were selected to the next interview round.
13 people were shortlisted.
 
 
    This interview lasted for about half an hour. Interviewer asked me to get comfortable. He asked me about the languages I was comfortable with and then asked some questions on OOPs.Then he asked some questions on linked list.
Q1) How to detect a loop on a linked list.
Q2) How to remove the loop.
After answering this he asked a few concepts of OS.
As I had completed my course on Computer Organization (Mentioned in Resume) he asked a few questions on that too.
Questions were based on cache system and processors.
Be very clear about what you write in your resume.
 
After this round 6 people were shortlisted.
 
This round was purely based on questions from Data structures and DBMS concepts.
This round was very long and lasted for about an hour and a half.
Firstly questions were from DBMS.
I was asked to draw ER diagrams of cricbuzz app. And also asked to write a few sql queries for retrieving data from the schema I had made.
I was also asked questions from a schema he gave and was asked to write sql queries based on that schema.
After asking questions on DBMS almost an hour had passed.
Then he asked me 2 Questions on Data Structures and Algorithm.
For this I had to write the pseudo code.
Q1) Given an array containing both negative and positive integers. Find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum.
Q2) Given a binary tree (not a binary search tree) and two values say n1 and n2, write a program to find the least common ancestor.
 
After this round 5 people were shortlisted.
    Two persons interviewed me one by one. I was asked questions based on DSA and some general-aptitude questions.
Q1) A modified version of Knapsack Problem.
Q2) A question to find the minimum spanning tree(Prim or Kruskal Algorithm).
Then I was asked about my project (I had done during the previous vacation) .
I was asked about my hobbies and since I had mentioned playing football ,he asked me to tell my views on the football world cup that just got over. This was basically to check my expressive and analytical skills.
I was also asked some OS based questions. 
The important thing here is that to be clear on what your thinking and expressing your thinking very clearly.
Even though you are wrong the interviewer might give you hints to the answer.
 
 Be prepared with some standard HR questions like
Introduce yourself,strengths and weaknesses,hobbies etc…
I was also asked : Why Arcesium ?
A difficult situation i faced in my life and how I overcame it.
Tell about your family members and what they are doing.
Tell about your day to day life (Daily Routine).
Hobbies and the extra-curricular activities from your Resume.
2 people were selected after all the rounds.

The interview process consisted of three rounds, an online test, a technical round and an HR round.
The online test consisted of questions based on Java, Linux, SQL etc. One was expected to predict the output and know the correct syntax. Students selected from the online test proceeded to the technical round.
The technical round tested my knowledge of Java, SQL and web development concepts. I was also asked questions about my academic history.
The HR round was a breeze, I was asked to describe myself and was asked questions about my family, education and plans for the future. When they encouraged me to ask them questions, I was able to enquire about the company and the job specification in detail.
I prepared for the placement season by brushing up on Data Structures and SQL concepts. I also made sure to acquaint myself with Java as per the job profile requirement. 
I would advise future candidates to read the job profile thoroughly and go through the concepts mentioned. Geeksforgeeks is an extremely helpful repository for anything pertaining to the placement process. Also, make sure you have a good grasp of Data structures concepts. The interviewers appreciate when you admit you don't know the answer to a question, instead of trying to bluff your way out. They are very friendly and are ready to help you reach the solution. De-stress your mind before entering the room. Greet them with a smile. It is most important to present yourself confidently and be very pleasant to converse with. 
All the best for Placements '19!

Adobe placement drive happened during October. They were recruiting only girls.  Students placed with a CTC greater than or equal to 14LPA were called for a direct interview whereas there was an online screening test for others. 
Around 12 students were called to Bangalore for an interview during October end. This recruitment drive was a part of their event 'She Codes' that was spread across days. I had my interview on October 31 and around 24 girls from various colleges were present on that day. Major topics covered in the interview were DSA and OS. There were 3 technical rounds and 1 HR round. After each round, they inform whether you are through to the next round or not. 
1. Questions on  OS concepts like scheduling, threads, semaphores. Most of them were rather straight forward. We had discussions over a few scheduling algorithms as well.
2. String manipulation question. The question was simple but they ask you to write the entire code and they expect you to cover all the corner cases. They prefer C/C++. 
3. Boundary traversal on a Binary tree. Initially, I was not sure of how the final answer would look like. I put forward the methods that I was considering and was kind of thinking out loud. This usually helps in interviews. Even when you feel you're stuck, it's important to let the interviewer know your thoughts. Maybe they'll give you that right hint which could help you reach the solution.
4. Questions from resume. I was asked about a project that I had done.
5. A few more questions from DSA and OS. Comparison of data structures. 
The feedback from each round gets sent to the next panel. 
1. Questions from resume. I was asked to explain my project from SE Lab.
2. Questions on binary search tree and binary tree. As the interviewer saw my familiarity with that question, he switched to a different one. 
Again, they ask you to write the proper working C code. 
3. Given a number, find the next greater number which is a palindrome.
This question has some corner cases that you could easily miss. There was a discussion on the approaches I had in mind to solve this. Most of them were cluttered and I started writing the code without a clear design in mind, because of which I had to struggle quite a bit in that round. So, before jumping into the code, try to sort out the design with your interviewer. Finally, I was able to convey my solution to him and he seemed satisfied. 
4. Questions on OS. Deadlocks, conditions, and semaphores.
5. Implement an LRU Cache. My initial approach was naive, but he insisted on improving efficiency and gave a few hints. He seemed happy with my solution in this case.
I cleared the second round. As it was already evening, my 3rd round (the Directorial round) was rescheduled to a later date and I was directly sent to the HR panel (supposed to be the 4th round).
1. Questions on the company and its product. What do you know about Adobe? 
It was more of a friendly conversation where the interviewer wanted to know a little bit more about me, rather than plainly what was written on my resume.
Researching about the company helps you a good deal in this round.  
This was an online video interview after I had got back to college. It lasted for around half an hour and the questions revolved mostly around my resume. 
He asked me how to implement web scraping. It came up because I had mentioned beautifulsoup, which is a library used for scraping the web. Thankfully, it was quite conversational and he helped me in my approaches. 
A few minutes later, I got an email from the HR lead confirming my selection. :)

<nimmikutty7@gmail.com>
CGPA cut off: 6 
Job location: Pune
There were three rounds in the process- An online test, a technical round, and an HR round. 
Online test:
 Most of the technical questions were based on data structures, Java, SQL, OOP, and Linux. It would be a good idea to brush up Linux and Unix. IndiaBix and geeksforgeeks can be useful resources. Even if you don’t code in Java, it’s better to know the basic keywords and syntax of the language. This can help you in predicting outputs or choosing the correct syntax. There was also a coding question- detect a loop in a linked list or find the GCD of given numbers according to certain conditions (depending on the set you get). There were also quantitative and verbal ability MCQs (refer IndiaBix and GFG).
After the online test, the names of the students shortlisted for the interview were announced. We had a pre-placement talk by the company officials. It is crucial to be interactive. I had talked to seniors who work there to know more about the company. I had also read about Amdocs from the internet. Do your research and ask questions.
There were two rounds of interview- one technical and one HR round.
Technical round: 
The interviewer scrutinized my resume. He asked me to explain my projects. He was interested in knowing in-depth about it. Be thorough with your projects. I had a machine learning project and he asked me about the language and the different technologies used in it. 
He then asked me to rate myself on a scale of 5 on different areas including programming languages. Be honest. If you simply rate yourself 5/5 in C, be prepared to answer difficult questions too. I can code in C and python and I told him that if the job requires coding in Java, I can learn that too. I feel it is important to show an interest to learn new things. I told him I was good at SQL. He then asked me the different queries I had used for my DBMS course project. 
Then he gave me a question to code- Check for the condition of checkmate in a game of chess. I asked for clarifications to gain a clear understanding of the problem. (It is advisable to do so.) You should also clearly explain to the interviewer all the different possible conditions you need to take care of. He then asked me to explain the code I had written and the different OOP concepts used. Some of my friends who got this question and could not answer it, told me after the interview that they were instead asked to design an online ticket booking system for a theatre. Don’t give up on a question too fast. Try your level best. They test your patience too!
He then asked me why I wanted to be a part of Amdocs. Also, about my academics. He wanted to know about the different challenges I faced during my course projects and how I dealt with them. He wanted to know how good a team player I was.
After about an hour, I was told that I had made it to the HR round. 
HR round: 
I was asked to introduce myself, talk about my family and my academic history. He also went through my resume and asked my areas of interest. He also wanted to know if I had plans for higher studies, I told I didn’t. He asked if I had any questions and I did ask a few of them. This round was pretty easy. (It is advisable to be prepared for the commonly asked HR questions.)
20 students were taken after the HR round and we were given the offer letters on the same day.
Have a smile. Be confident and fluent when you answer.
Good luck!

CGPA Cut off – 6.0 
CTC – 8.85LPA (Base Salary – 8.85LPA, Extra 20K settling allowance for outstation candidates.) 
Job Location - Pune 
No. of interview rounds – 3 (Online Test, Technical Round, HR) 
Online Test – MCQs based on DSA, Java, SQL, OOP, Linux, and Aptitude. (No Coding) 
Technical Round: 
I prepared for the technical round by brushing up my DSA concepts through GeekForGeeks. Apart from DSA, DBMS was one of my favorite and strong subjects, So I read it thoroughly. As the job profile mentioned the requirement of basic knowledge about Java and OOP, I studied and refreshed my knowledge about them. 
Questions (That I remember): Basic DSA concepts, Reverse a linked list (Was asked to write the code in a piece of paper), Normalization in DBMS, ACID properties, OOP concepts, Java Features, Why is Java independent? How do you update yourself with new technology and concepts? 
HR Round: 
It was very straightforward and easy. It started with the basics like Introduce yourself, SWOT, interests, etc. The interviewer inquired about my Family and Educational background. The interviewer checked for my ability and willingness to learn new concepts. Furthermore, questions about higher education, expected work span, etc. were asked. They also encouraged me to ask questions about the company. (Don't hesitate, Shoot as many questions possible, they love it.) 
Tips: 
Focus mainly on DSA and OOP concepts. 
Knowing Java inside and out will be a big plus for not only this job but a ton of others. 
Amdocs is a mass recruiter, so cracking the online test and a decent technical round can get you the job. 
If you make it to the HR round of any company, make sure you go into the interview with a few selling points in mind, such as what makes you the best candidate for the profile. 
Number of people taken – 20 (13CS,7EC) (Not Sure) 
Best of luck!

CGPA CUTOFF: 
➢ Usually, it will be 6, but to keep the placement student needs to maintain 6.5 CGPA. 
CTC & BASE SALARY:
➢ 8.85 LPA (Both CTC and Base) + 20k joining bonus. 
CHOICE OF JOB LOCATION:
➢ Amdocs has its offices at Gurgaon and Pune. ➢ 99% offer will be at the Pune office. 
ONLINE TEST :
➢ One Coding Question (Ex: Detect and Remove a loop in Linked list, Palindrome, etc.) 
➢ Outputs of code snippets (Java and C++ mainly) 
➢ Computer Networks (Ex: no of bits in MAC address etc.) 
➢ SQL queries and outputs of SQL queries 
➢ OOP ➢ UNIX/LINUX 
➢ Aptitude, English & Reasoning 
NOTE: Except for the coding question, rest all are MCQs and the entire test contains 64-70 questions 
NUMBER OF INTERVIEW ROUNDS
➢ 2 Rounds (1 Technical + 1 HR) 
➢ ROUND 1 
✓ Firstly, you will be asked to rate your proficiency in your subjects or something like “What do you want me to test you in?”. The Interviewer asked me what am I good at in decreasing order. I said DBMS, OOP, Data Structures, OS. 
✓ Then the Interviewer said he wants to start with “OOP” and asked if I’m comfortable doing so. After a “yes”, he asked me to “Write a code which includes every aspect/characteristics of an OOP Language”. In addition to it, he added, “Your code must give proper output if I run now on a Terminal” (I wrote in Java). 
✓ Once finished writing, he asked me questions on OOP concepts. “What is abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, etc.” 
✓ Once “what is” questions are over, he asked if any other important characteristics he missed (data hiding, Inheritance, etc.), and asked me to explain them (I explained all the concepts taking “Television” real-life example”). 
✓ “What primary- essential characteristics do a language require to be qualified as an OOP language?” 
✓ Now taking my code, he asked me to “Explain how and where the OOP concepts are applied and how it works if I give this or that input.” 
✓ After asking a lot of questions on OOP, he said he won’t be asking from DBMS but will ask on SQL. 
✓ “Write an SQL query to return all the IDs and total salaries of employees who have “non-distinct/ duplicate” ID entries from employees table (which has duplicate entries of Employees) where the total salary is less than the MAXIMUM total salary of an employee”. 
 Ex. (ID, ..., Salary, Name) 
ID Name Date Salary 
1 - A - 30/1 - 100000 
2 - B - 10/1 - 25000 
3 - C - 15/1 - 30000
2 - B - 20/1 - 40000 
2 - B - 30/1 - 40000 
4 - D - 29/1 - 50000 
3 - C - 30/1 - 20000 
From the above table, the output must be only (C, 50000) since its ID is repetitive and is less than the max salary of table i.e., (B’s salary 105000). 
✓ I was syntactically wrong, so he gave a hint “Use Group-by”. (Try it out :p ).
✓ Later he asked “Tell me any other OOP languages apart from C++ and JAVA” ✓ Since I wrote Php projects in my Resume, he asked if I can write code in PHP on paper. I said I would be syntactically wrong. He then chucked Php questions and moved on to Data Structures. (Asked me you’re a CS student and why did you mention DSA at last. Politely replied saying I’m not proficient in DSA ). 
✓ He asked me a question to “Write a code to find if a given number is a palindrome”. Firstly, I gave a Brute Force code. He gave a number and asked me to work as post “GCC q.c”. Secondly, he asked me if I could improve the time complexity. I did it in no time. Asked why didn’t I give this solution at first. 
✓ He then asked me a few random questions about pointers etc. 
✓ Finally, he asked, “How do I cope up and update myself with new technologies”. 
✓ “If our Institute provides us enough facilities and opportunities for development and projects, about my major project what are we going to do, etc., 
✓ Finally, a bye from Tech round. 
➢ HR ROUND 
✓ Introduce yourself. What is your family background? 
✓ What are your strengths, achievements, and weakness? 
✓ Why Amdocs? 
✓ Why is your CGPA way less compared to your 10th and 12th? 
✓ “If you can’t keep yourself in First Class grade (min 6.5 CGPA) in UG, your placement will be revoked” 
✓ He made us fill a survey form regarding locations, availability, etc. 
✓ HR done. 
TIPS 
➢ From the Interview you might feel, he didn’t ask me anything from my resume. Nope, he is connecting my projects, my ratings for subjects, and testing my knowledge technically as well as casually. This is a crucial phase where one might not focus. You need to be 100% thorough and proficient with your projects and all the contents in your resume. If provided time, you should be able to continuously explain the contents of your resume. 
➢ Do not “Fake”. It is easy to find if you are faking and the interviewer loses a good impression. 
➢ If you are not at least 90% sure just remove it from your resume or avoid talking or raising terms related to that topic. (As if you know many things). 
➢ If you are doubtful about anything just try asking politely to give a hint only after “Trying”. Pay attention to that hint and proceed with that. 
➢ If you cannot write code properly on paper then “Write loudly” (convey your idea to the interviewer). 
NUMBER OF PEOPLE TAKEN: 
➢ 20 people were recruited from the B16 batch.

There was no GPA restriction.
Job location: Pune.
It was stated that the CTC would be 15 LPA but later due to lack of required skills, they said that the CTC would be between 10 to 15 as more training is necessary. They took the consent of the students regarding the reduction in CTC before the last coding round. After that round, CTC was fixed to 12 LPA. 
There were a total of 5 rounds. The first was an online test followed by a coding round.
Online Test: 
In the online test, there was a simple coding question of basic level and one or two questions on HTML/CSS.
Face to face interview: 
In the face-to-face interview, basic knowledge of all the core subjects was tested.
In the later two coding rounds, 1 question was given to be solved in 3hrs in each round. The problem was expected to be solved using OOP concepts. This was one of the most unique interviews ever. We were allowed to take help online to solve the coding rounds. So all the focus was on how to solve the problem effectively using OOP concepts.
After which there was 1 HR round.
One member was taken from our college.

CGPA cut off: 7.00 
CTC: 11.44 (Base Salary: 9L, Joining Bonus: 2L, Other Perks: rest) 
Job Location: Bangalore 
No of Interview Rounds: 3 (Online, Technical, HR) 
Online test: 
MCQs based on DSA, JAVA, CPP, and Aptitude (No coding) 
Technical Round: 
The interviewer asked questions on DSA. He asked me one coding question. Then there was a discussion about my Major Project. Be thorough with the project that you are doing. In addition, he went through my CV and asked me about the other projects that I have done. Then he asked what my favorite subject is, and I said Operating Systems. Then he started asking about various topics in OS like process management, memory management, how a program is loaded in memory, which I find it easy because I completed OS Lab in my 5th Sem. 
At last, he asked me for some puzzles. One, which I remember, is a card game consisting of 4 players, and one of them is the dealer. While dealing with the cards, the dealer gets a phone call and goes out for a while, and when he comes back, he does not remember how many cards he has dealt with or to whom he has dealt the last card. Then how would dealer know from where he should start dealing again. 
HR Round 
This was a unique HR round because the interviewer was taking an interview of 5 candidates at a time. He will ask a question to anyone at any time. He asked me about my weakness and how do you work on it. Asked everyone where he or she heard about the company. There were two candidates from the CS branch, including me. Asked us who should get the offer letter. There were two candidates from the EC branch, and he asked them the same question. Other than that, there were standard HR questions. 
Tips 
Focus mainly on DSA. 
Be thorough with at least one subject. 
Do various puzzles. 
Try to read about the company and answer their questions during PPT. In the original shortlist, there were 36 out of which 6 were selected in a different company, and they were asked to include 6 other. The HR person told us that some of the new 6, were added to shortlist because they answered during PPT even though they did not do well in the online test. 
Number of people taken: 4 (1 CS, 2 EC, 1 EEE)

CGPA Cutoff : 6.5
Job Location:  Bangalore
Online Test: 
Some Aptitude/Objective questions followed by 1 coding question.
The coding question was something like this 
There is a music playlist array, with time duration of the songs, in seconds. Print all pairs of songs where the total duration is a whole minute/minutes ( meaning: no 1min 40 sec or 3 min 10 sec; Total time by both songs should be in terms of complete minutes only )
Suppose the array is [40,20,35,140,100]
Solution should print (40,20) (40,140) (20,100), (140,100)
Interview Round 1 : (Technical Round)
He asked a few questions related to DSA.
The ones I remember are :
He gave me two pretty easy array questions.
Later, He asked me to check if a linked list was a palindrome. And when I gave the optimized solution, he asked me what are the other ways u can do this question. The interviewer was very friendly and patient, so I was not nervous. I sat and wrote the other approaches (almost 2-3 solutions). And he was happy with it.
He asked me my favorite subject and asked a few basic questions related to that. Then he asked some DBMS queries and some OS terms like thrashing, paging, etc.  
Later, He asked questions regarding my internship and Project which were mentioned in my resume.
Interview Round 2 : (Technical Round)
The interviewer had some output questions with him. So he asked me for the output of those codes. Then he asked me about my internship and the work I did there, in detail. 
Interview Round 3 : (HR)
Just like any other HR round, this was more about personal interests and hobbies, and things one has mentioned in the resume. Some questions regarding your team spirit and ability to work with other people were also asked.
By the end, They selected 13 candidates in total.

Cut off: 6.5
CTC: 20 lakhs (16 base and 4 joining bonus)
The initial online test was conducted on the Hackerrank platform, it consists of two coding questions:
1. Given a string find the number of substrings that have all the vowels at least once.
2. Given a matrix with 0’s and 1’s, find the maximum size sub-matrix with all 1's. 
Tesco people didn't come to the campus and there was no pre-placement talk. There were two rounds for the shortlisted people one technical and one HR round. Both rounds were through video conference.
TECHNICAL ROUND:
He asked me about my internship and asked a few questions about that.
Asked to explain the OS project which we have done in our lab and some basic OS questions were asked:
 • why do we need to use threads?
 • Questions related to semaphores
I wrote java in my resume, so he asked some questions on java like
 • Difference between abstract class and interface.
 • overriding and overloading
Next the coding question,
 • Find the Kth smallest element in the array.
The interviewer didn't care much about this question and it seemed like he wants to quickly move to system design and for some people, even the coding question is not asked.
Design Question:
In apps like Amazon and Flipkart we have "frequently asked questions and answers" for each product, he asked me to design that part.
He asked whether I know Ajax or nodejs (this question was asked 3 or 4 times and my answer is No always)
He asked me which technologies would I use for implementing the design.
I said I will use java at the back-end.
Next, why java why not PHP, and what's the advantage of using java over PHP.
Where would I store the frequently asked questions and answers front end or back end?
Suppose it takes 5 seconds to access the data from the database, how would I decrease the time?
I told indexing can be used and explained to him how it can be done.
Whether caching be used for reducing the time?
Suppose a new question is added, do you immediately update the database?
Instead of immediately updating we can update for some batch of questions i.e. for every 10 questions we can update the database.
Difference between 1NF and BCNF.
Tesco's interview was a bit different from other interviews, they concentrated more on the design and application of OS and DBMS concepts.
8 students were selected for the HR round.
HR ROUND:
The interviewer introduced himself and started with the basic question to Introduce yourself.
He asked the internship details which I did, like company name, location, etc.
He asked me the technologies which I used in the internship, whether I already knew them or learned during the internship?    
He asked me to explain the process of how I approached my mentor and the learning process involved.
While discussing the internship I told the company has a friendly environment, he asked me to give an example for that.
Later, he asked me to tell something which I learned on my own without other's help and the learning process.
Finally, some extracurricular activities which I did during college and some discussion about that.
All the 8 students shortlisted for the HR round were selected.
Interviewers were more concerned about the thinking process rather than the correct answer, so it's fine even if you don't know the answer just explain to them your process.
For DSA Karumanchi book and Geeks for Geeks are very good resources and also learn the applications for each data structure.
Revise the projects which you have done and be perfect in them because in some interviews they will ask you to write the SQL query or all the tables along with table structure.
Do ask questions at the end of the interview and spend some time in knowing about the company.

Round 1: The test was conducted on the AMCAT platform and it had sectional time limits. It was comprised of MCQ questions including aptitude, logical and technical portions along with two coding questions. The aptitude section mainly consisted of questions related to data interpretation. The technical part covered questions from data structures and C output questions. 
The coding questions for me were: 
1. Check whether the path between two nodes in a given tree is a palindrome. 2. Determine the maximal sum of contiguous subsequences and non-contiguous 
subsequences in an array. 
Suggestion: I would suggest doing practice from sites like Indiabix for aptitude and geeksforgeeks for the technical part. 
Round 2: The second round was a technical round and the third round was a managerial round. As I had to attend another interview in parallel, my second round was a combination of both technical and managerial. The panel consisted of four people and the interview lasted about an hour. All of them went through my resume and then started asking questions from my resume. 
I was asked to explain my projects that are mentioned in my resume. I did an internship during my summer vacation and questions regarding my intern project were asked. I was asked about my favorite subject which is DBMS. They even asked me why is DBMS my favorite subject. Later on, questions from DBMS were asked. I was asked to draw an ER diagram, normalize tables for the given question. As I used the LAMP stack for my DBMS project, I was asked to explain the working of the LAMP stack in detail. Few SQL queries and basic DBMS conceptual questions were also asked. 
They stressed on my internship project and a lot of questions were asked from that single project. As most of my projects were based on DBMS, I was asked to design back-end for a page according to their requirements. Conceptual questions from OOP, Software Engineering, and Data Structures were asked. Coding questions from strings and linked lists were also asked. In the end, questions like my favorite language, long term life goals, why do I prefer to work after BTech instead of higher studies, why this company, strengths, and weaknesses, etc., were asked. 
Round 3: This was basically the HR round. This round was mainly to check my communication skills and spontaneity. As they were running out of time, it was just a 5-10 mins conversation about my extra-curricular activities, strengths, weaknesses, hobbies, etc. 
Finally, they announced the final list. Four full-timers and four interns were selected. Most of the questions were asked from the resume and our interests. So one needs to be confident enough about their resume and their favorite subjects. 
All the best for placements!

One of the happiest days of my life is the day I got placed. :D
After a lot of rejections, one of my (two) best friends and I got placed at CITIbank :p
Here’s my experience.
Online Exam:
In the online exam, there were Multiple Choice Questions. The questions were grouped into three sections, Technical, Data Interpretation, and Reasoning. The technical section mainly consisted of PL/SQL and SQL queries. The SQL queries were mainly JOIN queries.
Then There were 3 interview rounds.
First-round was a group discussion round. The topics of discussion were something about digital money and mass communication. There were a total of 21 people for the Group Discussion round so they formed 3 groups of 7-7 people.
The second round was the technical round. There were 4 interviewers(much pressure). They asked a lot of SQL queries (it’s okay not to answer all correctly because I didn’t :p), DBMS concepts, made some changes in one of the projects I had listed on my resume, and asked me to explain how that would be implemented. 
They asked some puzzles also.
The third round was the HR round. That was a good discussion about my hobbies, strengths, and weaknesses.
The offered position was Data Analyst plus 6 months mandatory internship.
3 people were finally selected.

CGPA CUTOFF : 6.5
Along with the application we had to submit a form giving full details of our 10th and plus two marks .There was no online test.
First round:
 First, they asked to introduce myself. Then the interviewer started asking a couple of questions in general. He asked me why I wanted to do an internship rather than spend my next vacation on doing something that may help me academically? Am I ready to learn something completely new as part of working as an intern? Will I be able to move to whatever location they ask? Is there any Citibank present in Calicut? 
The questions were basically progressing according to what I replied. I also noticed that whatever answer I gave they didn’t agree completely with any of them but rather questioned more with a slightly disappointed look. This might have been part of their interviewing strategy.
Second round:
 He asked directly about my project. Then he moved on to my college life other than studies. He also asked me about my strengths and weaknesses.
Preparation:
Be confident with your answers.
Read some interview experiences.
Look through some basic concepts of  RDBMS and Java since they had mentioned it on the document they provided. For me, these topics were related to what I had provided in my resume.

1 online round + 5 interview rounds 
Online round - We were given 3 coding questions. One Dp question, basic maps, and one logical question. The exam is for 100 marks and students who got 28+ got selected. 
36 students were selected for the next round. 
Round 1 
I was asked to introduce myself. 2-3 basic questions were asked. After that interviewer asked me to explain all my projects. Then I was asked to explain OOPS concepts. Then he asked for a complex data structure according to me and asked to explain traversal code. The last question was why Java is preferred over PHP. 
OOPS and DBMS are to be concentrated for this round. 
After this round 12 students were shortlisted. 
Round 2 - Legos 
It is a group activity where we were divided into 2 groups, given Legos, and asked to build a bridge. They tried to pressurize us using time constraints. This is mainly used to test our leadership skills and performance under pressure. 
Round 3 
Again I was asked to explain my projects. I was asked to write code for a Multi-Level parking system. Few SQL questions were asked. A few technical questions related to my resume were asked. 
Be confident with what you know. Don't feel shy to say no to concepts that you don't know. 
Round 4 - Managerial  
I was asked a few puzzles which are from Geeks for Geeks. Since OS was mentioned as my strength, I was asked to explain Process Control Block architecture in detail. I was then asked to explain my role in all roles and responsibilities mentioned in my Resume. 
Take a look at puzzles in Geeks for geeks. 
Round 5 - HR 
It was a simple round with simple HR questions. Check out some HR questions before this round. 
After this one extra technical round was conducted for me by the technical lead ( maybe because the technical lead hadn't interviewed me in any round). He asked for a basic understanding of DP. 
After Round 1 no shortlisted was done. 6 out of 12 shortlisted students were selected. 
I felt that they were testing my level of understanding. So whatever you are asked to try to explain it with examples.

SOME TIPS
For any company, DSA is a must-have. Start solving problems on various platforms like InterviewBit, HackerRank, CodeChef, etc.
Looking up previous Interview experiences on GeeksForGeeks and solving company-wise coding questions also helps greatly. Researching the company beforehand also creates a good impression with the interviewers.
During the Interview, interact with the interviewers and be clear when telling them about your approach towards solving a problem.
HR round sounds easy but it’s good to prepare answers for questions like Why should we hire you, Where do you see yourself in the future; so that you can answer them fluently when asked in the interview.

There was an online test as usual which covered topics like aptitude, os, dbms, computer networks, reading comprehension, and finally there were two self-description type questions.
Around 55 students were shortlisted for interview. There were 3 interview rounds:
1. Technical round
Started with self-introduction, was asked to explain about the projects in the resume, many questions on java syntax and few output finding questions. Was asked to write and explain the algorithm of quick sort, and also a few SQL queries. Asked about cloud computing: what it is, and its limitation. I was asked whether I knew about bitcoins, since I didn’t no further questions were asked.
2. Managerial/Technical round
Most of the other candidates got a second technical round, whereas a few got managerial round. I got the managerial round: Two situations were given, and I had to explain how I would handle each of them in the best possible way. A few puzzles were given. I was also asked to explain my favourite project. In the technical round questions related to OS, DBMS and OOP concepts were asked. Example: How an OS works explain it in such a way that a non-cs student would understand, SQL queries using group by etc.
3. HR round
It was the shortest round for me, after a brief self-introduction, the interviewer asked me why oracle and also about my previous interviews. The interview ended with him asking whether I had any questions for him.
14 people were selected: 11 B.tech, 2 MCA and 1 M.tech
Make sure you ask good questions at the end of each interview. Prepare well and be confident even if you don’t know all the answers. Geeksforgeeks is a great platform to prepare. Know your projects well and have good knowledge in core subjects like OS, DBMS and DSA.

CTC: 20 LPA (Base salary: 13 LPA)
Wells Fargo visited our campus for full-timers alone. Only B.Tech students from CSE were allowed to write the online test.
ONLINE TEST:
The online test had 3 sections. The first section was based on verbal ability. There were questions based on passages, vocabulary, grammar, etc. This section was pretty easy. The second section had questions based on finance. Most questions were based on the interpretation of graphs of stock prices. I found this section hard. The third was the coding section. There were 2 coding questions each with around 45 minutes. Both the questions were basic array manipulation questions.
Everyone attended the ppt and over half of the students who wrote the test were shortlisted for the next round.
WRITTEN TEST:
The written test had a duration of 1.5 hr. It had technical MCQs, Aptitude questions, and coding questions. The technical MCQs covered all the core subjects including OS, DBMS, Compiler Design, Networks, etc. The aptitude section was mostly puzzles. Many puzzles in geeksforgeeks were asked. 
There were 2 coding questions. First one, The recursive grammar of a language with literals a,b,c was given(similar to the grammar given when we draw state diagram in compiler design) and the program has to recognize whether the given input string belongs to this language or not. The second one, Given a set of words, A set of operations(like swapping 2 letters, removing the letter on left, move to the left, etc) and another input string; The program has to check whether the given input string can be converted to any of the words in the given set of words through a sequence of valid operations starting from the beginning of the string. An operation is considered valid only if the result of that operation is a string that belongs to a dictionary(a function belongs to dictionary can be directly used).
I wrote the complete code for the first one only. My answer to the second question was incomplete. I only mentioned the approach.
Around 12 to 15 were shortlisted for the next to rounds which were face to face interviews.
ROUND 1:
My interviewer was pretty friendly. First, he went through my answer sheet of written round and asked me to explain my approaches to both coding questions. He asked the ways I could optimize it. He asked me to write code for a simple array manipulation question. He then asked me, If I had 2 programs, one printing odd numbers and other printing even numbers from 1 to 100 how would I get the numbers from 1 to 100 continuously on the terminal. I suggested semaphores and wrote code using 2 binary semaphores. He also asked questions like what will you do if your laptop isn't getting connected to the network given your hardware and network is fine etc. 
He asked about my areas of interest. Since I mentioned ML, he asked how to automate data interpretation from a bundle of hard copies of some receipts. And in the end, there were questions like what do you regret most in your life, the day I had the greatest satisfaction to date, what will you do if you are given a job in a domain not in your area of interest, etc. 
Overall the round was pretty long but I think the interviewer helped me take it easy.
ROUND 2:
This was a panel interview. There was a panel of 4 members. All of them seemed to be very senior. First I was asked to introduce myself. He asked how well I was doing in my academics and the subjects I scored well. I didn't have a great cgpa, so I had to defend that. When asked about languages I am comfortable I had mentioned python, so one of them asked about packaging in Python. One of them asked about my projects and since I mentioned OS Lab, he asked about page replacement algorithms. Except for one of the interviewers, all of them tried to add as much stress they could by questioning my confidence in answering every question. The HR was sitting beside me, and asked me questions like ' I don't know anything about computer networks, Teach me networks', ' If you were the team leader and I was in your team and I didn't do any of the job assigned consistently even after warnings, will you fire me?'. 
Many such typical HR Round questions were asked. The HR even bluffed that I was rejected and later said he was joking. Overall, I felt the round was pretty stressful.

The shortlist was announced by the company on their visiting day after the ppt. We had a pen and paper test after that. The paper had few subjective questions, a few technical MCQs, and two coding questions. One question was based on arranging the given set of words based on the dictionary by using graphs. The second question was based on regex.
After this, few candidates were eliminated by the scores in this test. The first interview round was technical. The interviewer asked questions mainly based on DBMS and Data Structures. I was asked about hashing, mapping, and graphs. Sorting algorithms were asked in detail and I was made to write down the code of Merge Sort. Then the questions were directed towards my projects. I was made to pen down the ER diagram of one of my projects and also a few SQL code lines from my Web Prog project.
Then I was asked a few questions from the pen and paper test. I was made to write down the most efficient code for those two questions. The interviewer looked satisfied with all the answers and asked if I had any further questions for him.
A few were eliminated from the technical round and then I went on to the HR round. This was taken by a panel of four. It was a little intimidating for a moment. The first few questions were technical. Then they asked questions one by one. Then few situational questions were asked. One among them was to choose among two friends for a project given one is extremely brilliant and can finish the project single-handedly while the other person isn't of much help. Whom would I choose and why?
One question asked me to give them alternative ideas for the offline registration process for college admissions and to pen down codes for the same. Then I was asked about my family, projects, and marks to date. After this, they asked if I had any questions for them and we had a big discussion on a thing they had shown in the ppt. This ended the interview and the results were announced half an hour later and five of us got selected. :)

AUTHOR : VINEET JIJI CHERIAN
<vineetjc@yahoo.com>
CGPA Cutoff : 6.00
CTC : 18 lakhs   
Base: 12 lakhs
Choice of Location: Bangalore/Gurgaon
Number of rounds: 2 to 3, depending on the candidate.
Online Round: 
Around 20 MCQs on Data Structures and Algorithms, and two coding questions, one easy and one easy-medium in terms of difficulty, both on arrays and related operations. The easy one was sorting an array with the elements being strings of website URLs, given a particular condition. The other question was related to "concatenating" K copies of the same array and figuring out the Nth element in that "concatenated" array.
QUESTIONS ASKED IN EACH ROUND:
Round 1:
"Tell me about yourself" - an essential but overlooked question. This question gives you the first chance to connect with the employer. Plan bits of this question, by telling briefly about your past, present, and aspirations for the future. Highlight on your passions and your technical ability. The employers are indirectly asking you many questions behind this, like "Why do you want this job?" or "Why should we hire you?". Make sure to personalize this answer, because people relate to stories.
System design - " How will you design an 'Intelligent Invite' system?" - To plan out a system that recommends specific contacts to a user, to invite them to use the (GoMMT) booking service. You're initially provided with the knowledge of the user currently using their service and their contact book, which consists of just names and phone numbers. The discussion involved figuring out how to find relevant people to recommend to each user without demanding more data from the user. You're supposed to find out more about the backend system through discussion, make assumptions and verify them, and then work on solutions and validate them along with the interviewers. There is no perfect answer to this. You have to build upon discussion with the interviewers. During the discussion, the interviewers indirectly test you on your overall knowledge of DBMS, DSA, and Software Engineering principles.
"Given two tables, the size of one being ten times that of your RAM, and another being within the limit of RAM, how does one join the two tables?" - This question tests you mainly on your DBMS and OS concepts, and slightly DSA again. Over time, during the discussion, they branched off to ask questions on the side, that were unrelated but related to the answer to the main question, testing certain concepts.
"Why this company?" -  A standard question, but make sure this answer is personalized too. You may choose to highlight your observations from your reading, research, or the pre-placement talk. Be sincere to them and yourself.
Round 2:
(This question was (seemingly) based on my initial conversation with the interviewer.) System Design - "Figuring out a way to compare prices and other services provided on a hotel room across all competitors" - Through discussion, you're supposed to figure out how to quantify that, provider A offering a room "ABC", and provider B offering a room "XYZ" is the same in terms of the services provided and whether the hotel room is actually of the same type, to form a valid comparison. One also has to figure out how to extract this information (for instance, web crawling), store the information (how to arrange the data, SQL vs. NoSQL), standardize it, and the actions you should take based on different results from the comparisons (for instance, whether to reduce the price if another provider shows the same room for a lesser price). They indirectly tested on DBMS and DSA concepts, and whether one can understand the company's products and services and build a scalable solution.
Level order traversal of a tree and various modifications - normal level order traversal, zig-zag level order traversal (i. every other level is read in the opposite direction, ii. every two other levels are read in the opposite direction). This was the only question that was more direct than any other questions for me.
In the end, the interviewer told me about his experiences and challenges in the workplace.
TIPS:
(contains personal opinion)
I've provided many pointers in the description of my rounds.
In general, having a good foundation in DSA, OS, DBMS, and Software Engineering helps. Focus on 2nd and 3rd-year core courses. I cannot stress this enough. You may not be directly asked about explaining a concept, but they can test your knowledge through other means, like the discussions I had. Hence it becomes more important to revise these subjects well. Knowing it isn't enough, you should learn it in a way such that you can teach it to someone else (like the "explain a concept in 5 levels" (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLibNZv5Zd0dyCoQ6f4pdXUFnpAIlKgm3N)). Despite what I said above about not necessarily being directly asked a concept, you will end up having to explain it indirectly through discussion. That is where they note the detail in your learning.
DSA knowledge from the class should suffice in clearing the online round along with a little practice on the side, on coding platforms like HackerRank and CodeChef. I suggest checking out practicing questions by concepts that HackerRank has categorized nicely. CodeChef or CodeForces could serve as an optional practice by taking part in contests to test yourself with time. Geeks For Geeks is an excellent source for learning too. Use Interview Diaries to learn about other people's interview experiences to improve on yourself.
One thing different about this interview process if I compare it with many other recruitment processes was in their focus on system design questions, which shows their intent of hiring suitable candidates. Except for one, all the questions asked to me were not as direct as one could expect in a fresher's interview. The approach you take is more important than getting an answer. Also, after initial screening by CGPA and online test, what matters is your interaction with the interviewers. If you have trouble speaking well during an interview, practice it with a friend. Have a general idea about what you will answer to some "standard HR questions" but keep it natural. Your interaction genuinely can make a difference in your application. At the end of the day, they want to know if they'll like having you around at work. Some of that is even beyond your skillset. Your willingness to learn, your sincerity, and a good friendly conversation can boost your chances.
My interview turned into a discussion with the interviewers (which was good on their part), where we built the solution together instead of it being just a series of questions and answers. They expect good quality discussion, and more importantly, to build scalable solutions, which is key to good engineering. They made it a point to have a good discussion, but that also depends on how you interact with them and turn it into a good conversation from your side as well.
It's important to read outside your classwork to think on a higher abstraction level. I suggest starting by reading the following for getting an idea of how to think about system design questions - https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2ygV4E81AR and https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview/m2yDVZnQ8lG). You need to learn to think big (requirements of the system, constraints, estimations of capacity, design patterns, handling data, and other features), which will only come with extensive reading and some practice.

ROUND-I: (online test)
This round contained 30 MCQs on Data Structures (especially on graphs) and 2 coding questions. They are:
Given an array of integers and an integer K and indexes L and R, you have to find an element that is most repeated in between L and R when the array is repeated K-1 times.
Given a list of string URLs, sort them according to their count, and when two strings have the same count sort them lexicographically.
They shortlisted 31 students for ROUND-II.
ROUND-II: (TECHNICAL ROUND)
This round almost went for some 30-45 mins in which half the time interviewer kept asking about my internship and curriculum projects. He gave me some modifications to the project and asked me how would I do that (not the entire code but the approach and SQL Queries).
One data structures question: To find each alphabetic count in a string.
Asked me whether I had any open source contribution.
They shortlisted 15 students for ROUND-III.
ROUND-III: (TECHNICAL ROUND)
He asked me to write code for Spiral form of level order traversal.
Asked if I had knowledge of graphs. I said yes, so he asked about BFS and its real-life application.
He asked how do I get mutual friends in any social network platform and explain how would someone get recommendations of a person on LinkedIn. This round also took 30-45 mins.
They shortlisted 8 students for ROUND-IV.
ROUND-IV: (TECHNICAL+HR ROUND)

The online test consisted of two sections I guess. Mental ability and the other one was coding which consisted of 3 questions I guess.
Cgpa cut was 7 I think.
Ctc 18 with a base salary of 12
My interview consisted of 3 rounds and all of them were technical. They deeply test our technical skills. In the first round, they ask some basic coding questions from binary tree, bst, array, linked list, etc. They asked me to write a program to print the left view of a binary tree and dynamic programming problem
The second round questions mostly come from DBMS and they ask you a lot from your resume mostly about the projects you have done and it's better if you have previous knowledge of frontend or backend development because they are interested in that field.
The third round is a system design round were one is asked to design a system depending on a lot of instructions. They will help you out if you get stuck in between and try to grab maximum info from them.
MMT has offices in both Bangalore and Gurgaon. They recruited 4 people.

CTC - 22 lpa (base 14)
CGPA cutoff - 7
The online test was completely MCQ and had five sections - 
Quantitative
Verbal English
Computer programming
Logical
Coding
Each section had its own subsections with particular time slots to answer them. For example, a subsection with five questions had to be answered in thirteen minutes. We could take breaks after each section. The test was for two hours and not very tough. You can check out sample questions from https://prepinsta.com/oracle
70 students were shortlisted for the role of Member Technical Staff and 60 for Application Developer.
After the pre-placement talk, there was a written coding test. This wasn’t an elimination round, just a part of the first round. We were given two questions and asked to attempt any one within 45 minutes. In-built functions weren’t allowed to be used. I only recall one question -
Given an array of values, delete the values that occur three or more times consecutively (like Candy Crush) and output the resultant array.
Eg: input : 1 2 2 3 3 3 2 3
After initial deletion - 1 2 2 2 3
After next deletion - 1 3 
Output : 1 3
Once we submitted our codes we were called for the interview. The interviewer scanned my resume and asked me to speak about my internship project. Since most of my projects were related to web programming, I was asked questions from there.
He asked me to explain and draw the flow of control in a web application. I wasn’t sure what he expected but he told me to explain whatever I knew. Since one of the projects was done in LAMP stack he asked me about that, followed by questions about how validations were done.
Other questions were how a hashmap worked in java, collision resolution methods etc.
After this, we discussed the code I’d written. There was a mistake which he asked me to correct. He then told me to write a program to reverse a linked list quickly, and the interview ended there.
In this round too, I was asked about my internship and projects. He asked me what my favourite subject was to which I said DBMS. But he asked me nothing from DBMS. Instead, he asked from networks - what the different protocols were and where they are used (TCP, IP, ARP etc). We then moved to OOP concepts. He asked me the need for abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism etc. He put out scenarios in C++ and asked me the output and again, why we needed to use classes there at all. It helps to read thoroughly about OOP implementation in a particular language. 
He gave me one coding question - to find the minimum number of swaps to sort an array. 
( https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-swaps-required-sort-array/ )
I was thinking in terms of all the sorting algorithms and couldn’t reach the correct solution. What I did was discuss how many swaps each algorithm would take. We ended up talking about every sorting algorithm including its time and space complexity. I assumed that I’d lost it for not being able to solve it, but I was called to the next round.
From what I understood, the interviewer was trying to find out my strong points and stuck to the questions that I was confident in answering. He made me feel very comfortable and nodded in approval whenever I gave the expected answer. In answer to one of the questions that I asked him at the end of the round, he said that technology keeps changing and we’d always have to learn something new. But the basic concepts of computer science remain the same, and as long as we’re strong in them, we can learn everything else with time. 
This round was mostly HR for me, but it depends on the interviewer. Here we were tested on how much we paid attention to their PPT. I was asked what I liked the most about the presentation, which technology of theirs I was interested in and which section I’d like to work under. 
He then asked general questions like what makes me angry, and how often I go out to restaurants around here. This was a quick round. When the interview seems to get over quickly, I think it’s a good idea to continue engaging by asking them more questions. It was a bit like a two-way interview since I asked him about his own challenges when working at Oracle. :P
This was the final round and completely HR. The cliche questions followed - “Why oracle?” “What have you got to offer us?” “Where do you see yourself in five years?” “What are your plans for higher studies?” etc. 
In the end, 13 people were taken for Server Technology (9 BTech) and 13 for Application Development (9 BTech).

CGPA cutoff: 7 for CSE students. I’m not sure about the other branches.
CTC & base:  Oracle  package for Btech Graduates was 22(14+3+5) lakh per annum. 14 lakhs was offered as base, 3 lakhs as signing bonus, 5 lakhs yearly retention bonus (for 3 years). Other than the CTC the company offers reallocation bonus of around 2 lakh and other benefits such as travel, insurance and so on.
Online test & kind of questions asked:  The preliminary test was really long and lasted for about 1.5 hours. The questions asked were mostly from Java, Aptitude, Reasoning, Passage Comprehension and so on. Each section and their subsections had its own time limits. Some sections had time limits as low as 4 minutes. Management of time between each questions and prioritizing questions based on their hardness proved to be very useful. Oracle Applications and Server Technology side had the same set of paper(i.e same number of sections and subsections) but questions varied for each individual. Overall the preliminary test was of moderate difficulty and majority of the questions were from non-technical side
No.of Interview rounds  The number of rounds were different for each person. I was selected in application side and I had a total of 5 Interviews (4 technical and 1 HR). The shortlisted students from preliminary test were given an additional question to solve on paper shortly after the companies ppt presentation. The interviews started as early as 9:00am and finished at 11:45pm.
Questions asked in each round:
0th round (pen paper test):   Each of us were given 2 questions to solve and we had to solve one of them. One of them was a programming question similar to designing candy crush game. I implemented it using a stack. The main objective of the test was to test the correctness of the code since we cannot change the code or even test whether it works or not. We were asked to find the space as well as runtime complexity of the code. Everyone was send to the next round. The other question was something on BFS.
1st round (technical)   The interviewer started with informal talk about the campus as he was  an alumni of the 2002 or 2003 batch. After much informal talk, he asked me to explain the code of the previous question that I had written. He was meticulous and queried about each line and the complexities. I had to derive the mathematical proof for arriving at that space and runtime complexity.                         Next he asked me “ The solution you gave is something an non–cs student can figure out on his own ! how can you optimize this solution from the perspective of a CSE student ? ”. I added an Additional Dictionary based hashing technique to improve to runtime complexity sacrificing the space complexity. Later we discussed on creating a balance between the two complexities. Finding Loop in a linked list, Bridge crossing puzzle and mathematical problems were some of the other questions asked during this round.
2nd round(technical)   The round started with a self introduction and the interviewer was fascinated by my project on graph database. The round had a lot of questions on databases and python. After a few set of questions, the questions became more hard. In the end this round was entirely on technical knowledge and Projects.
3rd round(technical)   The questions asked in this round required industrial ready code(ie clean code with all boundary conditions satisfied). The question was about M cubes with N sides with each side having values from 1 to N. We have to find no of ways in which we can obtain a sum of X. The question requires Dynamic Programming and I was able to solve it easily. He was satisfied in the way in which I solved the problem from scratch. The next question was a modified problem based on Kadane’s Algorithm.
4th round(semi-technical)   The interviewer for this round was a senior developer/manager. He gave me a series of situational based questions and some classic HR questions like “where do you see yourself in 5 years ?”,” what would you do if subordinate disagrees on your decision” & “what was my opinion on Higher Studies?”. Later we went on to discuss about one of the ongoing project at Oracle on Autonomous databases and related that with my project.
5th round(HR)   This was an ordinary HR round with basic questions.
Job profile / Position  The job profile was for a Applications Developer.The Oracle Applications product development team designs and develops Oracle's applications software (also known as business software).
Tips :
Be Confident and interactive: Try to engage in conversation with your interviewer and don’t make it a one way communication. Use hand gestures, Situational examples and diagrams to enhance the clarity of your answers.
Be sincere: give correct information during your interview and be ready to back up any claims that you give with proof. Keep your resume compact and precise. Don’t exaggerate the facts. At certain point in interview, it would be better not to divulge full information. In my case, they asked me why I had Low CGPA(it was 7.2). My answer was that I had lost most of my CGPA to certain courses (non -core courses) and said I had good grades in Core courses including DSA and DAA. The reality was the other way around . I had D grade for DSA and Rgrade for DAA. My answer was followed by a series of questions on Graph algorithms and Dynamic Programming. So be ready to face the consequences.
Lead/control the Interview : control the direction in which the interview is going on. You can decide the topics for the interview depending on the answers you give. You are successful if you drive the interview into a field that you are well versed and comfortable in eg: ML, DL, DSA, DBMS...
Be Prepared : Read about the company and the profile that you are opting. The Resume should be company specific ie focus on company requirements. Always have an answer for classic interview questions which are availbale on online platforms(Google-“top 10 interview questions”). For Oracle, Prepare for Aptitude to clear the preliminaries and focus on Java, OOPS, DBMS and DSA for the interviews.
Choice of job location  I had opted for Bangalore as my first option followed by Hyderabad and Trivandrum
No of people taken  Initially they selected around 14 for server technology and 8 for applications. Later they added 3 more persons to the applications side.

CTC: 22LPA which includes
Base salary - 14LPA
One time bonus - 3LPA
Retention bonus - 5LPA

Online Round
The online test was for 2 hours with questions relating to mathematics and aptitude. You cannot get back to a section and re-attempt the questions. However, you can change your answers within a particular section while you have time.  Consider that you'll have to submit the questions manually at the end, i.e you run a risk of your answers not submitting at the end of section if the time limit ends and will jeopardize your chances of the interview.
Pen and Paper Test
After the PPT, there was a pen and paper test in which each of us was given 2 questions to choose from and to write a clear solution in any language of our choice.
The questions were:
1) Candy Crush
Recursively remove all adjacent duplicates of size three in an array.
Input: 1 3 3 2 2 2 3 1 4
Output: 1 1 4
A simple stack solution would suffice in O(n).
Similar to the question in here - 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursively-remove-adjacent-duplicates-given-string/
2) Rotten Oranges
Find the minimum time required to rot all the oranges.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/
The number of interview rounds for me were 3 (2 Technical + 1 HR)
Round 1
The interviewer was very friendly and asked me many questions relating to my interests, the movies I watched, my native place (things to break the ice). Then he skimmed through my resume. We discussed my internship and about the work I have done. He asked me questions regarding "GOOD" programming practices like documentation, comments, macros for magic numbers, and questions on trade-offs like time and space.
He glanced through my projects and asked me to give a brief description of each of them. He asked why I choose those projects as my resume varied substantially from others.
 
He then skipped to some easy technical questions
1) A basic question in which an array is given, we will have to find the frequency of each element/ remove duplicates(which I don't remember exactly) in O(n) 
2) Water jug puzzle
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-water-jug-problem/
We then had some discussion about Oracle, the work he does, customers of Oracle as shown in the PPT, how oracle works, the range of products offered.
Round 2
This round seemed like a mixture of two rounds.
Again, the interviewer was friendly and asked some questions to break the ice. He inquired about why I have done a particular project and during what period of my B.TECH I have done those. Then he asked why I haven't worked with Java. I replied I woked well with C and didn't get much of a chance to work with Java. A rapid-fire round of questions relating to C began. The questions were:
° What is the size of a structure with 2 integers, 1 character, and 1 double?
° Difference between 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
° What is Structure padding?
° Why is Structure padding necessary?
° What is the second normal form?
° What is a dangling pointer?
And some questions relating to core concepts of C language which I don't remember precisely.
I was then asked to design Zomato (because I acknowledged I used it). 
I gave an approach involving the various features to be included in the way and naively described how they would relate to one another.
He seemed satisfied with the approach.
We then had a discussion about my internship and also about my weaknesses.
Then we spoke about his role and some products from Oracle. He seemed very satisfied with my performance and the discussion.
HR ROUND
This one round should be dealt with utmost care.
The round began with some discussion on my projects and my performance in the previous rounds. Next, there were some questions like 
° How was your day?
° How were the previous rounds?
Don't be adamant in answering these, as they reflect how well you can speak to an interviewer.
Questions answered were like
° Why Oracle? 
Prepare in advance, if possible include points discussed in the PPT describing how the PPT made you feel enthusiastic about the company.
° If you were given an opportunity for masters in one of the finest universities, would you accept it or stay in Oracle? (Trickiest question)
If you answer, either way, you would give a negative impression. Leaving an MS from a good university might sound bogus while leaving Oracle isn't good to answer either. Giving an answer like if you would have equal research facilities in Oracle itself you wouldn't leave oracle would be good to answer.
° If one of your team members is dumping his work on you, how would you deal with such a situation?
Then she discussed the life-style in Oracle (flexibility in work, timings, gym, sports :P)
Tips
° Be true about your resume. If you aren't completely sure about something, don't put it on your resume.
° Don't give up or refuse to solve a problem. Even if you don't know how to solve it at least try to formulate a way to solve it.
° RESUME MATTERS! Make sure it looks good and keep only the required details.
° Revise your favorite subject thoroughly.
° Be confident, don't stress yourself too much. 
° Believe in providence, things will turn out to be fine.

Online Qualification Round
The online qualification round was hosted on their own platform, in which following sections were there:
Logical Reasoning
Verbal Ability (Grammar, Reading Comprehension, Fill in the blanks)
Quantitative Aptitude (some maths related questions)
Basic Computer Science questions related to Data Structures and Algorithms,Operating System, Database Management System
Coding Questions (basically they were output questions related to Data Structures like AVL, Graphs,Trees,etc)
Software Engineering Principles (some flow charts questions)
Duration for this round was only 2 hours and that too with time restriction on sections as well as sub-sections, once the time is over or you skipped some questions you cannot go back to it to mark the answers. So be careful while attempting the test and try to manage time properly.
Note: Be thorough with basic concepts of DSA, don’t ignore Data Structures like AVL,RBT,Binary Tree !!!!!
Around 45 people were shortlisted for the next round.
1st Technical Round
Before starting the first round of interview we have to give a 45 minutes non-elimination pen and paper coding test. Two questions were given and we were asked to solve the second one while Full Timers were asked to solve first one but hopefully I knew both.
First Question was related to BFS on matrix and second one was related to use of stack and hash maps for testing your knowledge of Data Structures.
Within half an hour I was able to solve the second one and wrote neat and clean code on paper.(Note: Whatever assumptions you are making must be clearly mentioned). 
Once the test was over interviewers began calling students one by one,when my turn came I saw interviewer was holding my resume as well as the paper on which I wrote my solution (the 45 minute test) :o
He began asking me various optimizations for my solution and asked me to solve first question also, which I solved within 15 minutes.
Then he gave me some puzzles, asked me to write an algorithm for printing a matrix spirally inward, divide an array into two sets non-empty sets S1 and S2 such that sum of all elements in S1 is equal to the sum of all elements in S2.
As the first round was over we were waiting for our name to be called for next round.
Around 20 people were called for next round.
2nd Technical Round
Compared to the previous round this round had less number of advanced questions.
Interviewer asked me to implement a Trie for english as well as hindi language (hint: using UTF-8 encoding), he asked me advantages and disadvantages of Trie Data Structure.
He asked me some questions related to various Hashing Techniques, Hash Tables, Collision Resolution techniques because I mentioned hash table in my solution (45 minutes test!!)
Some questions were also from OOPs - encapsulation,polymorphism,abstraction,real world examples of mentioned concepts.
He asked me to use other Data Structure if not Normal Trie I answered I will use Suffix Tree which is a Compressed Trie where keys are suffixes and values are positions.
Note:
Be thorough with OOPs
Revise Data Structures and Algorithms
Go through previous questions.
3rd Round (HR Interview)
Describe yourself in one word.
Describe Oracle in one word.
Share your Oracle interview experience starting from first round.
Rate yourself on a scale of 10 for your performance in the interview.
Why would you like to join Oracle?
Throughout my interview Competitive Programming helped me a lot, which is the only thing I am interested about in all of my Computer Science course. Try to gain basic computer science and mathematics knowledge instead of various programming languages,development because these changes very often but the basics remain the same. Try to master yourself in particular language rather than having inferior knowledge in many :)
You will often hear that CGPA are not important but trust me CGPA matters a lot during interviews so try to maintain a decent CGPA throughout your four year.
One should be aware that interviews are very tiring process, one should never lose their hope and stop trying. Keep your fingers crossed and get the most out of every situation. After all, it all depends on your knowledge(40%) as well as luck(60%).
All the best for your future interviews :)

SERVER TECHNOLOGY INTERN
AUTHOR : ROSHAN R
COMPANY : ORACLE - Server Tech
CGPA cutoff: 7.0
Hi. This is my internship interview experience with Oracle. I will describe how the recruitment experience went for me, along with the things which I felt are essential for performing well for the internship drive. It had been a long time since Oracle visited our campus to take in interns, along with the full-timers.
Selection Procedure:
ROUNDS - Online MCQ -> Pen and Paper Coding Round along with Puzzles -> Resume review and Project Discussion -> Group Discussion.
 There was an online preliminary test consisting of mainly MCQ type questions that I felt weren't as difficult as the previous tests I attended. A little brush up on DSA, basic aptitude and English vocabulary and grammar would get one in as they happened to shortlist a lot of students.
The shortlisted students were called upon to give a 30 min Pen and Paper Round with a choice of 2 Questions. I wasn't sure of the first question and decided to get on with the second one, which was to recreate the Candy Crush game in one dimension wherein numbers disappear/burst if there are more than one coming together. The question framed was a bit tricky, and most of us  thought it was just a duplicate removal problem when they came together, and I was asked to explain the code to the interviewer. 
Tip: Make your thoughts flow through words while you think, and if you are stuck or unsure of any corner cases, please feel free to let your interviewer know what's troubling you. Thinking in terms of corner cases can sometimes give a good impression to the interviewer.
Next set of problems:
 Given an array of integers and a sum, conclude whether the sum is possible with the given inputs. I came up with a costlier solution at first which he wanted me to improve upon, and when I gave him a solution using HashMaps he seemed convinced and gave me another problem which you can find here:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/
I wasn't exactly sure of the question, and I repeatedly kept asking him how the output would be in case it is not a square matrix but I somehow captured a majority of  cases and showed my not so perfect solution.
Tip : Even if you are not able to code the entire solution, don't lose hope and confidence. Keep trying, and don't feel bad to say you don't know when you don't have a single clue regarding it.
Puzzle: You can go through GeeksForGeeks. I was asked a similar one to
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-21-3-ants-and-triangle/#:~:text=There%20are%203%20ants%20sitting,along%20edge%20of%20the%20triangle.&text=Hint%3A%20Every%20ant%20has%20two,which%20ant%20is%20initially%20sitting).
Resume review and Project Discussion:
 This round consisted of answering questions relating to the stuff I had put into my resume. 
Tip : Try to avoid putting stuff into your resume unless you have a reasonably good knowledge regarding it and you can talk about it for about 2 minutes.
Group Discussion:
 It was getting late (almost midnight) as there were many shortlisted students, and they chucked the HR Round for a Group Discussion. Be prepared to introduce yourself and respond to 
Why do you want to join the company?
Tell me a fun fact about you.
How has the whole day been?
Describe the company in one word.
Tip: Don't forget to read up about the company thoroughly once you get shortlisted.
It took them a little while to announce the final list, and most of us who cleared the first two rounds got in.
All the best :)

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER
AUTHOR : MOHAMMED SHAHRAAZ HUSSAIN
<shahraazhussain@gmail.com>
Stipend: 1000 USD (~74k INR)
CGPA cutoff: None
I am not allowed to tell you the exact questions and solutions in my interview process. But I will briefly explain the process step by step.
Online test Link:
I found online test link over here company's Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/codenationIL.india/) and filled the google form. Later I received the HackerRank hiring contest link over my email.
Online Round: ~July 21 
(I don't have a sharp memory :P)
Test started at 10:00 AM and ended at 11:30 AM overall three questions
Sieve + Prefix sums: Okay level problem. The question itself was not so tricky, but heavy optimization was needed. ~ Solved
Gcd + Matrix Exponentiation (20 X 20): Tricky question, it was hard to come up with a DP solution and then looking at constraints (1e18) I decided to do this later. I was able to device the states of DP (slower version) and submitted to get partial points, but could not optimise further in the time limit. ~ Attempted
Dp + Graphs: Ok level Problem. A not that hard, pretty common problem on DAG + a twist. ~ Solved
Overall solved 2 out of 3 problems very fast. Two days later, I got a notification that I am shortlisted. 
Note: Just practice on codeforces.
I read online about the next rounds here (http://codenation.co.in/hiringprocess.html). 
Round 0: Resume Round 
Round 1: Coding Round
Round 2: System Design Round
I was pretty confident about Round 0 and Round 1 but was not sure If I am going to crack Round 2. But On-campus placements had started, so I could not devote much time for Round 2.
Fast forward to July 31: 
Arcesium Interview- This had indirectly influenced my chances at CodeNation (Read about Arcesium Interview Process here)
Online Round: Ok
First Round: Ok, after this Round only four people were left for the next process
HR Round: Ok
Second Round: Design An attendance Application. I freaked out I knew this is a system design question, and I was not prepared at all(Reading online about these topics was one thing and answering such questions is another thing). So my performance was bad (if I had not failed in this part, I would not have taken System design round seriously). Then they asked me a question about postman on 2-d grid (you can go up, left or right) finding least number of moves to deliver post to all points.
Overall Rejected. I figured out that either my CGPA (I had least CGPA<9 and all others had 9+ CGPA) or system design was the reasons for my rejection. 
I took some time to reflect on the process. I had two options:
Increase CGPA (not feasible in a short time)
Improve System design skills
I chose 2nd Options. I got in touch with super seniors in senior SDE positions (https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) and Anu Madam (Madam gave me her textbooks on Software Engineering). With the help of them, I got all the resources needed to master System Design. But what I lacked was the time which I arranged somehow(secret process).
Fast forward to Aug 7: 
Round 0 : CodeNation aka Resume Round
Telephonic interview, link to resume is here
Interviewers went through every part(different people for each part) of my resume. They wanted to be sure that my resume is genuine.
We talked about my projects and CP experiences of each other.
He asked me If I have any question. (I asked him about the hiring process :P, did not take this seriously)
The company did not declare result. But I was optimistic about the next Round. So kept on preparing.
Note: Aim is to check if the resume is legit, don't bluff on your resume.
Next day: 
Oracle Interview- This had indirectly influenced my chances at CodeNation (Read about Oracle Interview Process here)
Online Round: Ok
First Round: Ok, but i messed up unknowingly. We were given a questions paper with one question on each side. Interns were asked to solve the problem on the back, but I was holding the question paper wrong way and attempted the wrong problem. (T_T)
I was sure about rejection, but I kept on trying hard and gave my best whenever i could.
Second Round: Some technical questions later, He asked me If I have any query. (Took a deep dive asked everything xD)
HR Round: Ok
Overall Accepted This boosted my confidence. Realized answering behaviour related questions is essential.
Fast forward to Sept ~10-20: 
Round 1 : CodeNation aka Coding Round
Interviewers opened the question from Online Round and asked about my solutions. He observed that I could not solve matrix expo problem.
Question 1: Questions on Matrix exponentiation apart from code I was also asked Time and Space complexity of my algorithms.
Question 2: weird question on optimization some process. I was given a slow algorithm and told to speed it up. Firstly I gave algorithms with time complexity O(N^2*log(N)). I took some time and read out loud my thoughts to the Interviewer he would tell me if I am in the right directions after four wrong ways to solve the problems I cam up with a proper algorithm. But Interviewer had a different algorithm in his head, so I had to convince him and one more member about the correctness of my greedy algorithms. Then I was asked to code this approach up; Interviewer was impressed by my approach because my approach needed less space than the intended solution and same time complexity + my code looked clean.
He asked me If I have any question. I asked about his own interview experience and his CP journey.
The company did not declare result. But I was optimistic about the next Round. So kept on preparing.
Note: Aim is to check your problem-solving skills, you will be asked questions until they are satisfied that you can solve new problems and express your approach to the interviewer. You can ask for hints if needed.
2 Days later:
 Round 2 : CodeNation aka System design Round
Interviewers asked me what all do you know and my expertise(he was typing this out as I speak). Based on that, I was given an open problem.
He told me about a system that already exists, and I have to add some a feature(This problem was an NP-hard problem, so no exact answer exists). We talked about how do I suppose database must look like and how am I going to update the database and all that(I had suggested a geo-location-based sharding). We talked about the software that is going to solve the problem and throughout the process interviewer was pretty much keeping a poker face (-_-).
This round is very crucial because, during intern, we did this every time a new feature is to be added. VP would ask to state a problem and collect many ideas and analyze the issues, then chose the most crucial issue and then we all brainstormed a solution with him.
He asked me If I have any question.
Note: They want to know if you can build systems. This involves something more than just what people usually think development is. You need to demonstrate the ability to solve huge scale problems with software given the resources.
Next day I received my offer letter :D

SOFTWARE ENGINEER INTERN
AUTHOR : AKSHAY A R
<akshay_b170529cs@gmail.com>
Rounds : 
5 rounds - 1 online qualification round + 3 technical rounds + 1 HR round
Online round : 
This round had 30 MCQs (15 technical + 15 mathematics and aptitude) and 2 coding questions. There was negative marking for MCQs. So I answered only 10 of them for which I knew the correct answer. 
The first coding question was an easy one. But as the problem statement was a little ambiguous to me I left it and moved on to the next one. The second one was a problem that could be solved either using Union-Find-Disjoint-Set or using DFS. I used the DFS approach and got all test cases passed.
After this round, 15 were selected for the interviews.
Interview round 1 (technical) : 
First of all, I was asked to introduce myself.
Then he gave me a dynamic programming question and asked me to write a complete working code on a paper. This was a moderate level question and I was able to solve it as I was active on CodeChef at that time. He asked me to derive the time complexity of my solution which also I did.
Then came a set of questions on OOPS. They were direct questions and I was able to answer all of them.
He then asked why DBMS is preferred over file systems for storing data. 
Interview round 2 (technical) : 
This round was a bit longer than other rounds. There were two interviewers and both of them would ask questions one by one.
Interviewer: Suppose that you have a sorted array whose size can grow or shrink dynamically. You have to search for an element in this array. What data structure can you use if you don’t want the searching time to change drastically when the array size changes?
The answer that he was expecting was Skip list. I started with binary search and after a few iterations, I arrived at skip list. Then I was asked to explain the working of skip list which I did.
I was asked for an algorithm to solve the Trapping rainwater problem. I answered it even if it took some time.
Few other questions asked in this round were, how to detect a cycle in a directed graph, how to reverse a linked list in O(n), why do we prefer 2’s complement over 1’s complement, etc. All these were standard questions and I was able to answer them properly.
Some basic questions were also asked on the x86 instruction set as I had mentioned that in my resume.
4 were shortlisted after the first two rounds of technical interviews.
Interview round 3 (technical) :
The interviewer asked which was my favourite programming language. I said C++. Then he started asking a few questions on C++.
First, he asked how the Map data structure was implemented in C++ STL. I already knew that STL maps were implemented using Red-black trees and explained that to him.
Then he asked how the power function was implemented in C++. I replied that I never used the power function that C++ provides. Instead, I used a custom made power function implemented using binary exponentiation. So I had to explain the binary exponentiation algorithm along with its time complexity.
Few other questions were also asked which I don’t remember.
Interview round 4 (HR) : 
This was a very cool round. 
HR: What is your dream company? 
I said Google. He asked what quality of Google I saw in Arcesium. I gave an answer with which he was satisfied.
Meanwhile, he noticed that I am an introvert and then he started a conversation on introversion and extroversion. He asked me about my family background, my hobbies, the place where I came from, etc. 
He also asked why I decided to take computer science and what I would have been if I were not into computer science. I said I would have been a professional pianist.
It was already 10:00 pm when all four rounds were over and we had to wait for another 20 - 30 mins for the results. The results were announced by 10:30 pm and 2 of us were selected.
We were called to a cabin and were gifted a Wildcraft backpack, a spill-proof coffee cup, and a t-shirt with the company name and logo printed on them. After that, we had a small conversation with the interviewers. They asked for feedback on the interview and we also asked their names and places.
Few tips for cracking an internship interview at Arcesium :
Arcesium demands good programming and problem-solving skills in you. Be thorough with different data structures and algorithms, especially dynamic programming and graph-related ones. Make competitive programming a habit. This is really going to help you.
Do one or two projects in which you will learn and implement different concepts of object-oriented programming.
Have a good idea about the company you are applying for. This will make HR rounds easier for you. Either search online or ask your seniors for this.
So this was my interview experience with Arcesium. It was an overall good experience for me.
Hope that this post helps you. In case of any queries, you can always reach out to me.
Good luck with your journey ahead !!

SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN
AUTHOR : SHREY KAUSHIK
<kaushik.shrey5@gmail.com>
Place Of Internship - Hyderabad.
Stipend - 100,000 per month.
Eligibility Criteria -
 CGPA - 7.00.
 Courses allowed - M.C.A, B.Tech Computer Science & Engineering, B.Tech Electrical & Electronics Engineering, B.Tech Electronics & Communication Engineering.
Rounds:
There were 5 rounds - (Online exam + 3 technical rounds + HR round).
Online exam had 2 coding questions, around 15 aptitude questions, and a few technical questions.
One coding question was related to disjoint set union data structure + combinatorics and the other was an implementation based question related to strings.
15 people were shortlisted after the online round.
First technical round - The interview started with an introduction and my interests.
Then the interviewer asked some questions related to OOPs like the difference between abstraction and encapsulation and other basic questions.
Then he gave me a coding question and asked me to write its pseudocode on paper.
The question was as follows - Given a number n, using the digits of n, make the next greater number.
7-8 people were shortlisted for the next round.
Second technical round - This round was based on data structures and algorithms and some basic questions from operating systems and DBMS.
He also asked some questions related to the projects which I had done during my summer vacation.
I was asked to write the pseudocode for the following question - 
A company consists of a hierarchy in which each employee has a manager(except for the boss).Given any two employees in the company, find their common manager which is at the lowest level of hierarchy.
This question was reduced to finding the least common ancestor(LCA) of two nodes in a binary tree.
My initial approach was something using a stack data structure which was not efficient.
I was able to come up with an efficient solution eventually.
It is advised that you discuss whatever approach comes to your mind.
Then you can keep on making your solution more efficient gradually.
Then he asked me a question based on graphs which was an application of Floyd–Warshall algorithm (Dynamic Programming).
Another dynamic programming question was some variation of the Subset-Sum problem.
Tip: Be good in DP.
Third technical round -
I was asked to implement some basic functionalities of an editor like redo, undo(used stack).
Then I was asked to write the pseudo-code of the following problem -
There are n bars arranged in a row. Given n non-negative integers which represent the height of bars each having a width of 1, find the volume of water which will be trapped after it rains.
It is a greedy problem (requires some observations).
The second question was as follows - A postman is standing at the origin of a cartesian plane and he needs to deliver the posts to n houses (x and y coordinates of each house is given) which are located in the first quadrant. 
He needs to deliver the posts in such a way that the total distance he covers is minimum. He can travel only right and up(going down or left is not allowed).
Find the order in which he delivers the posts.
4 of us were selected for the HR Round.
HR round - 
Questions like "Why would you like to join Arcesium?", "How would you contribute to Arcesium?" , “What is your biggest strength”, “What is your weakness” and so on were asked. 
Finally, 2 were selected for the internship.

JUNIOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPER
AUTHOR : MANDYAM REDDYSEKHAR
<reddysekhar14651@gmail.com>
Place of Posting: Bangalore
CGPA Cutoff: 7.00 with no current backlogs
CTC: 49.75 lakhs
(Base 12 lakhs + 35 lakhs RSU + 1.2 lakh yearly bonus + other benefits) 
Atlassian visited our campus on July 30 2019, for Campus recruitment. Initially, they conducted an online coding round. 
Online Round Questions:
It consisted of 3 questions to be solved in 90 mins.
1. Given a string containing a path to a directory and allowed operations are:
moving to the previous directory(..) and stay in the current directory(.). It’s the same as how the ‘cd’ command works. ( I don’t exactly remember the question precisely like input format and all.. roughly written)
Ex: String: a/b/c/d/e
Operations: .a/b/c/d/e
     ..a/b/c/d/e
2. There are some cities which are connected by roads and distances from one city to another city are given. You need to build a hospital in one of these cities. Now you need to find out the city at which hospital should be constructed such that the sum of distances from each of those cities to the city, at which the hospital is constructed, is minimum. (Basically, it is an All Pair Shortest Path Algorithm with some additional functionality of finding optimal node) 3. You are given a generic tree and each node has an integer value associated with it. You need to find out the largest sum starting from any node and ending at any node. Here tree edges are bidirectional. Here the input is given as a set of node-value-parent combinations.
5 students were selected after this round. 
Interview Rounds:
Round 1:
The two interviewers in this round were currently working as software developers at Atlassian, Bangalore. They asked me the following questions in the first round. 
• Given a set of integers and a value S, determine if there is a subset of the given set with sum equals to S.
Input: 1) Set = {3,34,4,12,5,2} Sum=9
Ans: Yes as {4,5} subset's sum=9
2) Set={1,4,23,-5,12} Sum=-1
Ans: Yes as {4,-5} subset's sum equals -1 
He asked me to tell him the approach. First I came up with a recursive solution and showed him the code. He asked me if I can improve the time complexity. Then I answered him that since the given problem has overlapping subproblem property, it can be solved using Dynamic Programming. Then he asked to write the code. After the code is written, he gave a couple of test cases and asked me to construct a DP table. Then he asked me if I can retrieve the set that has the sum from the constructed table and I told him how to get those values from the table. 
• MS Excel columns has a pattern like A,B,C,...,Z,AA,...,AZ,BA,BB....BZ etc. Given a column name, find the corresponding column number.
Ex: Input: AAC  Ans: 705
Input ZZ  Ans: 702
Input: AB  Ans: 28 
• A question on the application of string matching which I don’t remember exactly. 
• There is a large hotel with an infinite number of rooms and the rooms are numbered. Guests will be coming and leaving the hotel on daily basis depending on the number of days he/she booked the hotel room. You need to allot the minimum possible numbered room to the newly arrived guest. Devise an algorithm such that Allot, Free, and GetMinNumberedRoom operations are performed. 
First I asked him the minute details such as where the data is stored. He told me not to worry about the storage thing for the moment and asked me to suggest my approach. I gave him a linear approach at the beginning and it worked. But he asked me if I can optimize. Then I suggested to him the Min-Heap approach and he seemed to be satisfied with how I approached the solution to the problem. (Here it’s worth noting that even though you know the most optimal solution to the given problem, try to start by giving the brute force solution and start improving from there and finally come up with the optimal solution. By this way, the interviewer gets to know your approach to the problem, your thought process, etc.) 
• Then the interviewers told me that their assessment of my technical skills is over and asked me to relax. Then he asked about the places that are worth visiting in Kerala, about college life, things I liked and disliked at NITC, my favourite subjects, and other such info. 
• Then we discussed about Atlassian and the scope of development for Atlassian in Bangalore and the kind of projects they are currently working on in their Bangalore office. 
Three members are shortlisted after this round.
Round 2:
This round was also interviewed by two persons who are currently working as Engineering Managers at Atlassian. 
• We had an elaborate discussion on the project I did at Microsoft, Hyderabad. 
• What are the things you learned at Microsoft? 
• Generate URL Shortener service like bit.ly. We had a discussion about it for almost 25 min. I suggested him approaches like Hash map(Collisions are possible), random URL technique, using hashing functions such as md5, etc.
• About my habits and I said I read books and play cricket and badminton. Then they asked me the books that I have recently read and what that book is about. This has been asked to check if that’s actually my habit or I am just bluffing. 
• They asked me if I had any questions. I asked them about the projects they are leading and the challenges they are facing. 
• Then I asked a question that “Every company starts boasting about their culture but for most of the companies, seems like it is restricted just to the paper. So from that perspective, how do you define Atlassian's culture? (They asked me to ask questions as silly as possible and I came up with that question. Basically I wanted to know their decision-making process, the scope for personal career growth and other such essential info from Engineering Manager’s perspective) 
• Then the interview ended with all the best from both the interviewers. (By this moment, I became very confident that I nailed the interview) 
After this round, Only 1 person qualified for the next HR round.
Round 3:
This round is taken by Head of Talent Acquisition at Atlassian. This round lasted for almost 45 mins.
• How are you feeling now? 
• How was the interview procedure right from yesterday evening? 
• Tell me something about Atlassian that I didn’t tell in the ppt yesterday but you researched after going to the room. 
Well, I did some research about the company after going to the room and told him the things he didn’t mention in the ppt. It made him feel that I am really interested in the company) 
• How would you define yourself one year before and now...If someone asks you about the traits and skills that you have developed over the past year or so, what will be your answer? 
• You and your friend are working on a project and there comes a situation where you and your friend have different opinions/decisions on the next step to take in the project(which is also the most important stage in project development), what would your approach be? 
Here, I mentioned the OS project and how my friend and I resolved the differences in the approach in such a situation by making a critical analysis of which approach optimizes the project. 
• How was your experience working as an intern at Microsoft? 
• Why you failed to get PPO at Microsoft? Well.. There are multiple factors involved and I explained those to him. We can do nothing about the things that are not in our hands. I gave my best during my internship at Microsoft. I did what's in my control. PPO decision is never in my control. So be cautious.
• How you dealt with the refusal at that point of time? 
• Do you regret not getting PPO at Microsoft?
• Why should I hire you? 
• Lastly, he asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked about silly things such as work timings, Place of posting, and other perks that are provided by the company. 
After 30 mins, results were announced, and I got selected.
Some tips:
• Start coding in different platforms like Hackerrank, Codechef, and practice problems topic by topic in GeeksForGeeks. 
• Practice, practice, and practice. Practice as many problems as possible in Data Structures and Algorithms. Make sure that your basics are strong in DSA. 
• Make sure that you have some good projects to mention in the resume. 
• I recommend that if you are doing an internship, do some side preparation for placements as well. If you don’t get PPO, then you can be ready for campus placements. If you neglect the preparation and you don’t get PPO, then you will have to suffer a lot at the beginning of the placement season. ( I was very confident that I would get PPO at Microsoft and I didn’t do any preparation during the internship, but my preparation in the third year while sitting for internships was pretty strong and I was able to overcome the hurdle of not preparing during the internship through that way). 
• Data Structures and Algorithms by Narasimha Karumanchi and Crack the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell are good books for the preparation. 
• Make sure you can communicate your ideas and approach clearly to the interviewer. 
• Prepare your answers beforehand for general HR questions like Tell me about yourself, why should I hire you, etc. and be honest while answering behavioral questions. 
• Finally, it’s all about your mindset while preparing. You may have to face many challenges in this process. Don’t get disappointed by failures and as people always say “Failures are stepping stones to success” and try to learn from the mistakes you made. Apna time aayegaa.... 
I hope my interview experience helps you in one way or another during your preparation and I wish you guys all the best.

Cisco visited campus on the first week of August.
CGPA cutoff – 7.5
CTC – 31.7 L
Base – 12 L per annum 
Possible job locations – Bangalore, Chennai, Pune
ONLINE TEST
First round of selection was an online coding plus aptitude test. Numerical and technical questions were easy to medium level. Out of the two coding questions, one was intermediate level and the other was a bit tougher. I could complete only the first question
INTERVIEW
There were three rounds of interviews.
First round was technical. It lasted for half an hour. They started with my projects. Since it was ‘Operating Systems’  based, they asked me about the working of real OS, scheduling etc. Then, they tested my coding skills. They gave me 3-4 coding questions which I was able to solve. They were easy to medium level and I was asked to write the complete pseudo code. Be completely thorough with your resume.
Some of the questions asked:
a)  Explain various scheduling algorithms used by real time OS.
b) Which among them is considered to be the best?
c) Reversal of a linked list
d)  Print elements at a given level of a binary tree
Second round was kind of a pressure round with rapidly asking technical questions. Questions were not specific to my areas of interest. I felt like they were interested to know how I approach questions that I am not familiar with. They asked the specifications of my preferred laptop and how the location of an electronic device without a sim card (ex. PC) is determined. I tried to give sensible answers quickly.
Third and final round was HR. It was typical questions like why Cisco, where do you prefer your posting location to be,  why should we hire you etc.
I was selected with 3 other B techs and 1 M tech student for the position of Software engineer at Cisco.
What I have understood from the overall interview experience is along with the basic subject knowledge Cisco was analyzing my personality and whether I am truly interested in the company. Just be you and have presence of mind while answering the questions.

AUTHOR : VISHAKH SUKU
<visakh1998@gmail.com>
CTC : 31.77 base : 12
CGPA cutoff : 7.50
4 rounds - 1 online test and 3 interviews
1) Online test
It had several mcqs and 2 coding questions. mcqs were simple and most of them were output
type and basic networking questions. Geeksquiz can definitely help you out here.
2) First interview - Technical
I was greeted by two interviewers and after formal introductions i was asked to solve the following problem.
Given n. Generate all possible n X n magic squares.
Simply put, I had no idea on how to solve it :-/.
See although i'm not saying that this was a tough problem (but i later came to know that my fellow interviewees were also asked much tougher problems) but the basic idea (as i learned from my seniors) is that whenever they give you a difficult problem, most companies and their interviewers never expect you to give them a perfect solution, instead they are interested in how you approach the problem and intend to solve it. This is where communication plays an important role. Make sure you clearly communicate your ideas and how you intend to solve it. This part is very important. In my case my interviewers were super supportive and had their entire attention on me, and it never hurts to ask them for help if you get stuck, and i had lots of help from them.
I made a lot of mistakes while solving it(some dumb ones too ;-) ), but was talking clearly communicating whatever was in my mind. After a lot of help i was able to achieve some sort of solution. I was also given another string manipulation problem which was fairly easy. After this i was asked a lot of questions from my resume and my internship projects.
3) Second interview - Technical
I was again greeted by two other interviewers. Both were from our college and we had a little informal chat about the college back then. One of the interviewers took my interview last year during internship placements. They didn't ask me any coding questions but they had great interest in my resume and internships. Being asked stuff from your resume is something you can expect, so i advise you to prepare everything that is there in your resume beforehand for every interview. STAR approach can greatly help in framing your answers. I was asked about my tech stack, what all frameworks i was familiar with and a lot about my internship project.
They were fairly impressed with my answers. They also asked me about the difficulties i faced during my internship and how I managed to overcome it. See this type of behavioral questions are somewhat tricky, never answer them by badmouthing some person you have worked with. They are essentially checking how you can perform as a team in not-so-good situations.
Generally tend to end these answers on a positive note like how you overcame it and how it improved you. Gayle Laakmann’s “cracking the coding interview” can greatly help you out here.
I also asked them a lot of questions about the company, the culture, team organisations etc.
Research about the company before you sit for an interview, this can greatly help you in framing questions. This interview took the longest and lasted for about 1 hour.
4) Third interview - HR
This was very short and i was asked some common HR questions like why Cisco, future plans etc.
Overall Cisco unlike most companies tends to repeat their questions that they have asked during previous interviews. Practicing these questions on geeksforgeeks and leetcode can greatly help you. Their interview process is also a lot simpler and friendly relative to most other companies.
So practice can definitely help you. Have confidence in whatever answer you are saying as they value it most.

To start of, the whole process of recruitment started during the second week of our 5th semester for the interns.
Cisco conducted 2 rounds, the first one was an online test for shortlisting candidates and the other one was the interview.
Online test
It consisted of a coding question which had around 10 test cases to be passed from which I managed to get 8 correct, it was a simple question on strings.
Along with the coding question there were few questions to check on general aptitude as well as some networking based  questions.
Also some questions were language specific like JAVA. If you know it, it is beneficial I did not know anything in prior about JAVA.
The marking policy was without any negative marks so make sure you make intelligent gueses.
After this round from among a pool of 150 students around 30 were shortlisted for the interview process which was going to be held a day after.
INTERVIEW ROUND
I had prepared and revised all the concepts of dsa for my interview but to my surprise what caught the attention of the interviewee was my interest in blogging, he started  by asking some random questions about my interests and what I blog about, I mentioned social issues,  feminism and moreover whatever is in my heart I pen it down. Then he started to ask about my projects. I mentioned about one project which I am currently also working on, it is based on path planning of UAV. That time, I had just started to work on it so he did not go deep into the area but he checked my knowledge by asking some questions which were open ended. Then I mentioned about my interest in blockchain and how I wrote an article on it in my second year. So he tried to check my confidence on the concept which I was blabbering about. I told him that I read a book by IBM on blockchain and I was very much clear about the fundamentals and I even tried implementation of the genesis block. 
He then gave me a linked list and asked me how would I handle an issue if a person maliciously tries to insert a node in between the linked list.
This I answered on the basis of my blockchain knowledge about having a hash function and how linking is done to ensure that if malpractice occur the information will be send to all the nodes as it is a distributed concept and no central agency is there.
In between he tried to confuse me through checking my dsa knowledge and how I connect that with blockchain but then in a minute i arrived with the correct solution
He asked about my skills, i said competitive coding , so he asked about how do i rate myself. To answer this i mentioned how in NITC mostly people are already knowing coding from there high school but I was a different case I had no prior knowledge, i told him that i did not rank myself any less than the other people if my coding skills are judged. Being practical at the same time i told him that few people are great at it and I'm at a learning phase.
He tried confusing and checking my confidence in between many times but he was supportive too.
I would say just buckle up, do coding regularly, manage your subjects well with curricular activities, for me CSEA was a blessing, also never loose confidence because this is what is being checked.
Most importantly never bluff in your resume and your resume should stand out not in terms of attractiveness in terms of what you have done. 
ALL THE BEST

Recently Cisco networks visited our campus for Summer Internship.The selection Procedure comprised of two rounds
FIRST ROUND-CODING ROUND
The coding round consisted of one Coding question and 20 MCQ’s.The coding question was quite a easy question on strings.The  MCQ’s comprised of basic C questions, output of a program concepts of recursive function,OOPS and Data structures and half the questions were related to Electronics which was totally new for me but as there was no negative marking I attempted the questions.For non Electronics background people need to get rest of the questions right.out of 200 students who sat for it 32 were shortlisted for the next round.
SECOND ROUND-THE INTERVIEW
Before the interview started we were told about role and duration of internship .Then the interview started I introduced myself I told him I like problem solving hence I do Competitive Programming, he asked me have I participated in any Hackathons I told not yet but I’m looking to participate very soon. I told him I do Competitive Programming on various Coding platforms. He asked the languages I’m familiar with, I told him I know C and C++. He asked what language was taught in my curriculum I told C.He asked then how and why I learnt C++.I told him I referred online tutorials, he asked why I switched to C++,to which I replied  due to OOP’s he asked me benefits of OOP and what is backdraw of using C.He then asked me about
OBJECT
CLASSES SUB AND SUPER CLASS
INHERITANCE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PUBLIC,PRIVATE AND PROTECTED
ENCAPSULATION
ABSTRACTION
FRIEND FUNCTION AND THEIR PROPERTIES
DERIVED CLASS
PROPERTIES OF DERIVED CLASS
POLYMORPHISM AND ITS TYPES 
FUNCTION AND OPERATOR OVERLOADING AND DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
I told him the types of polymorphism but I told I don’t know the details he was satisfied with all the answers.He then asked how comfortable I was with Data Structures I told him I had studied during Summer vacations and I was quite comfortable he asked about my favourite data structures and reason why I like them .I told I like Linked list because I can insert anything in between and I like BST because I can search and insert in Log(n) time .He then asked me about BST deletion he asked me to write the code on a piece of paper, after he reviewed my code he gave me example and asked me to dry run and asked to show all the possible cases of deletion (4 cases) on the given example.The toughest of it was to delete the root(which was easy actually).he then asked me write a code for reversing the Linked list I said I have two solutions one recursive and one iterative he told me to write the code for iterative one.I wrote the code to which he again reviewed and again gave me an example and told to illustrate  my code on the example.He was quite convinced and asked me how would I compare two no if they are equal without using arithmetic operator .I replied we can use XOR operator.He then asked me  whether I have any questions to ask ,I asked him about the kind of projects I will be offered and languages and any skills I need to learn.I asked him about the opportunities in IOT as I have done a project on IOT as Cisco has been highly involved in IOT related projects.He told me about the kind of projects they are working on.
The interview Went on for 30-40 minutes after that 10 people made it .
Key take away from interview:
Be thorough with what he has asked, try to communicate and ask if he needs the best complexity solution or just the solution.
Whatever the interviewer is gonna ask he’ll ask in depth so be well prepared about things you know.
It’s not about how much you know rather it’s about how well you know what you know
Prepare your resume nicely be thorough with what u have written in it don’t bluff I repeat don’t bluff
Have a good interaction with the interviewer don’t forget to ask your doubts, your questions. It gives the impression that you are really interested in this opportunity.
Read about the company in advance the projects they are doing and prepare questions accordingly.

Preliminary test : 
It was an online test. There were general aptitude questions (similar to speed time), questions to predict the output from given code snippets, some questions from electronics, networks(IP address),etc..
Interview
Round 1:
The interviewer was so friendly. He asked for a Self-introduction, then asked to briefly explain about my B Tech projects that I wrote in my resume. He asked some questions related to my project. He asked about the languages I am good at. Then he asked to write a code in C for extracting messages from the packet sent through the network (like IP address, mac address, actual message, etc.). While coding, he wanted me to explain the packet flow through the
network and the protocols related to each layer. After coding, he asked questions related to binary search, linked list, binary search tree(to draw BST, its advantages, etc.). And finally, he asked to write code for finding loops in a linked list.
This round went for around 50 minutes.
Round 2 :
The interviewer asked questions related to the Operating system( Processes, Threads,
semaphores, etc.), related to Memory management( malloc function). I was then asked to write a pseudocode to find the number of 1s in a given number. This round went for around 20 minutes.
Round 3 
This was an HR round. The interviewer asked questions like ‘Why CISCO?’,
‘What are your preferred locations’? etc..

For Cisco, we had an online test followed by an interview. There was one coding question based on string manipulation. And then there were questions from data structures and basic programming. About 30 people were selected for the interview. 
In the interview, I was asked to solve a matrix question (similar to Sudoku ) and I had to write algorithm ( pseudo code) using divide and conquer strategy. I am not sure if my answer was absolutely correct but the interviewer was satisfied with it. Apart from that, he asked me question based on my resume. He asked me about my interest (which I told him Mathematics and AI). I had been doing an Artificial intelligence on NPTEL doing summer vacation. I was asked what I learned in that course. 
Altogether 10 people were selected for the internship.
I would advise that 
Improve coding. Almost every company asks one or more coding question with significant weight to it. Also learn dynamic programming as in many companies test, I saw question which could be solved efficiently by dynamic programming.
Be thorough about basic data structures.
Write a skill in resume only when you are confident about it. It is very probable that you will be asked question about it. And when you don’t answer correctly, it will create a bad impression.
Be confident when you answer for sometimes they only want to see our approach.

I had an HR interview with Cisco. Anil sir was the one in charge. It was quite an enjoyable experience. He was a great personality and I see that it is an honour to work with him in the future. He took great care to calm down my nerves before we could even start. His questions were all aimed to see if we would work hard and whether we were honestly interested in what we were signing up for. He asked a few questions about my favourite subject and reasons behind the answer. Being an alumni he was very kind in advising about studies and other academic related things.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER (NETWORKS S/W R&D)
AUTHOR : SIVA VARDHAN REDDY
<ka.siva1998@gmail.com>
Place Of Posting : Bangalore 
CGPA Cut-off: 7.0 
CTC: 13 Lakhs (Base 11 lakhs + 1 lakh joining bonus + 1 lakh retention bonus) 
I got selected in the Samsung R&D Institute Bangalore on Sept 4th, 2019. 
Round 1(coding) :
First-round was an online coding round in which we are allowed to do on their coding platform. We are not supposed to use any in-built library functions except those of basic functions such as memory allocation/deallocation, printing, and scanning. It consists of one question with time 3hrs. The problem consists of 50 test cases. Only those people will be selected who clears all the 50 test cases. 
Given a binary matrix of size m*n. A laser when applied along a column, complements the entire column(changes 0's to 1's and vice versa). Given k, the number of times laser to be applied along columns. You can apply laser on any column any number of times such that the total number of times laser applied is k. The rank of a matrix is the number of rows with each entire row consisting of 1's. After applying the laser k times on the given matrix, the problem is to find the maximum rank. I have created a binary array of size m. 0 and 1 at ith index in the array indicates laser is applied even and odd number of times across the ith column(1 in the ith index of the binary array indicates to complement ith column in binary matrix). Let s be the sum of the binary array. If (k-s) is a multiple of 2 then it is the case that laser is applied k times. For each permutation of the binary array, if the above condition is satisfied, the rank will be calculated from the laser applied matrix by counting the number of rows with each element as 1 and max_rank will be updated with rank if rank>max_rank. A normal brute force solution won't pass all the test cases. I am not sure whether there is any DP solution with less time complexity. 
I was the only one to get shortlisted for an interview. The further rounds were conducted online through skype.
Round 2(Technical) :
This round starts with a discussion on the first round coding question. Here are some questions that I remember during my interview. 
What is your favorite sorting algorithm? 
Complexities of insertion and deletion in a heap. Height of a heap. 
How will you find the kth bit in the binary representation of a number? 
Basic questions on syntax and semantics of memset function. 
What is Dynamic Programming? What are the different approaches in DP and what is the difference between the methods? 
What are the different system-calls and explain them in detail? 
What is mutex and how is it different from semaphore? 
Given an array and sum. Find whether any number of elements in the array add to the given sum or not. First I explained the brute force solution by finding all the subsets of the array and adding them. Later I gave him the approach of DP. He asked me to write the entire code in any language and asked to construct the DP table as an example. Design an algorithm to maintain dynamic memory allocation. First, I tell the basic approach to maintain all the memory blocks using a binary array(1 indicates the corresponding memory block used). Then I suggested that we can represent it by linked list ADT(refer to fixed memory allocation in https://silcnitc.github.io/run data structures/heap.html) 
Round 3(Technical) :
This round starts with asking my feedback on the previous round. I explained my project during the summer internship. I have been asked a lot of queries(NoSQL and SQL). This goes up to 45 min. Few other questions were asked in java. 
What is the difference between a class variable and a static variable? 
 Explain the different types of access modifiers? 
 Explain briefly about the memory allocation for different types of variables? How a class variable is invoked?
When two variables point to the same memory location and one variable frees the memory location, where will the other variable point to? 
Explain the concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, data abstraction? 
How do you detect a loop in a linked list? 
Tips 
Practice coding questions on geeks for geeks, Hackerrank. Solve as many as possible. 
Don't add too many projects in the resume. 
Refer "DSA by Narasimha Karumanchi” for Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Be confident about what you are saying.
All the best for your placements!

BUSINESS ANALYST - UBER
AUTHOR : NABHAN ABDULLA P V 
<nabhu123@gmail.com>
CGPA Cut-off : 6.5
Location : Hyderabad
Uber came to college in the first week of September 2019. There were two different profiles they initially posted for application - Business Analyst(Analytics & Reporting) and Business Analytics(Data Science). The former had a CTC of ₹7.5L and the latter around ₹9.5L. To put things into perspective, most of the companies at the time were offering >₹12L and also being not software engineering roles, there was relatively lesser participation. The cut-off for the application was set at 6.5 CGPA and the work location, Uber's Hyderabad office.
I applied only for the Data Science profile as it felt from the A&R job profile that it involved more of making presentations rather than technical work.
Preparation
I went through a bit of descriptive and inferential statistics and also basic data science topics like preprocessing data. I also worked on SQL problems and looked at some advanced SQL commands apart from the commonly used ones.
Selection Test
The test included questions on statistics, probability, and aptitude. There weren't any coding questions but had some on SQL syntax and output.
Interview
Around 25 of us got shortlisted for the interview. 
The company presentation introduced us to work done at Uber's Hyderabad office and the type of projects they are working on. After the presentation, there was more of a clarification on the differences between the two job profiles. In short, the DS role was more of a senior position with almost the same day-to-day responsibilities as that of A&R. They also mentioned not providing the DS position for undergrads normally.
First Round - Technical
It was the first interview I had attended, and on noticing me being nervous, the interviewer went on to ask about my non-academic interests. We had a quick chat on India's 2012 match against the Aussies which MSD, as always, finished off in the last over. The seemingly casual talk led to the first question. I was asked about computing the estimated run total for a team in an ODI match given their status after 10 overs. The idea is to respond with different ways of predicting the total. I started with the trivial, naive extrapolation method wherein if the team scored 60 in the first ten overs, they'll end up scoring 300. I followed up this solution with a couple of other methods where estimates are made in a data-centric manner i.e. taking advantage of the data from previous matches and by also utilizing other parameters like wickets down and leading/trailing in the series.
There were questions asked to check familiarity with statistical distributions, SQL functions, percentiles, etc. 
I gave an overview of the project I worked on during my internship. As I had listed some machine learning and data science libraries on my resume, the interviewer asked the difference between Tensorflow and Pytorch.
The interview was more of assessing the ability to understand problems and coming up with different perspectives for the solution utilizing data in hand. Most of the questions can be approached by someone who has invested time learning or revising stats & SQL recently.
About 10 mins after the tech round, I was told they aren't providing the DS position, and I could proceed with the HR round if willing to go forward with the A&R role. After the presentation early morning, I was almost convinced about the role, but anyway I asked for more clarification about the work involved.
Second Round - HR
After learning more about the role and the responsibilities involved, I found no reason not to go forward with the interview.
I introduced myself and was asked about my relatively lower grades(around 7 CGPA). I replied that my grades had been decreasing till the 4th semester, but I've been improving over the past two semesters.
A scenario for Uber Eats starting in Calicut was given. I was asked what metrics/attributes will be the most important if I were to provide daily growth measurements to the regional manager. I said around 5-6 parameters like total daily turnover, new customer rate, the ratio of order cancellations, etc.
In the next scenario - I am the analyst in the customer support division of a region for Uber. The complaint rate for the region is 10%. If I were to reduce the rate to 5% in 3 months, what will be the top five measures to take?
Some of the methods I suggested were to find & resolve the most common type of complaint, predicting possible instances leading to complaints from the previous complaint data, standard complaint reduction practices, etc.
Some of the questions I had for the HR were - 
Does Uber provide learning opportunities for their employees?
Are internal discussions held on completed projects or new developments made?
The interviews were over, and I was asked to return to TnP after around an hour. One of the hiring team members told me they were willing to hire me and briefed me on the pay scale and other perks. 
The base salary was ₹8L(as opposed to the ₹7.5 CTC as published earlier). Some of the benefits include transport and food allowances.

CGPA cut-off : 7.00
CTC : 28.75 lpa
Base : 13 lpa
 The possible job locations were Bangalore,  Hyderabad, Chennai, and Delhi. A couple of months after the selection they will mail you a form asking for the preferred location.
Number of people taken: 1
Online test
This was conducted on mettl and different people got different questions. Some were hard, some were very easy. My questions were
Find the number of inversions in an array.
You can do it in nlogn time using Merge sort.
I don't remember clearly. But it was a very easy implementation question, like finding the number of numbers less than and co-prime to a given number or something. A simple brute force solution would suffice.
Round 1
Given a matrix of 0s and 1s, find the largest group of 1s. 
This was a basic graph question. I solved it using DFS. 
Find the missing element in an AP where the first and last elements are not missing. This you can do in O(n).  But the interviewer wanted a more efficient O(log n) solution which can be done using binary search.
Round 2
This was my bar raiser round and the most difficult round. I was asked to implement the least frequently used cache(LFU). When there are multiple entries with the same least frequency, select the least recently used from them and remove it when the cache is full. 
You have to write a fetch-from-cache function that finds the LRU among the LFU in the cache. This can be done in logn time using a heap. But the interviewer wanted an O(1) fetch.
So I used a doubly linked list. The interviewer did try to help me at times when I was stuck. I had to write the entire working code in C for the implementation of the cache. 
Round 3
This was a design round. I was asked to design and implement a logic gate simulator. A logic gate simulator is a software where you can drag-drop logic gates and give connections to simulate a logic gate circuit and find outputs. 
The gate functions are known. For example, if the gate G is AND, let's say for two inputs a and b, G.func(a, b) is given where G.func does AND of a and b.
I used a recursive struct to define the connection with a prev so that I can fetch the outputs of previous connections and use it as input for the present connection. My connection struct included the gate G, two prevs for the connections bringing the input lines and an output variable which would store the output of G.func. 
Round 4
This was a chill round. The first question the guy asked me was a common greedy problem called the job sequencing problem. 
The second question was quite hard. I was asked to implement n stacks using an array. This can easily be done if you use extra space to keep track of the stack pointer. But I was asked not to use any extra space. So u needed an array of pairs where each entry stored the value to be stored and the index of previous stack top. This is required because stack push and pop have to be O(1).
Then I was asked a few basic operating systems and java questions.

One coding question and around 20 MCQs.
The coding question was easy. Given n pairs of strings, the first is an id, and the second is the project. Given q queries of id's, we need to print all its projects in sorted order. The solution is to create an adjacency list of the ids with the edges being the projects.
The MCQs were on Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Data Structures, Algorithms, Networks. Logical ability, Quant, and some general tech-related questions like the full form of NVME. 
Interview rounds: 3
 Technical, HR, Technical
Round 1 (Technical):
Tell me about yourself.
How was the online test?
Solve a particular logical question that you couldn't solve in the online test. The interviewers wanted to know how I approached the question in the test and asked me to try a different approach. I couldn't solve it even then.
What is the topological sort?
Questions from my resume on the projects that I have done. That included some basics of DBMS and networks because my projects incorporated these technologies.
Round 2 (HR):
Obvious HR questions.
Tell me about yourself.
Why this company?
What do you do in your free time?
...
Round 3 (Technical):
Questions from my resume based on the projects that I had done.
A project of mine was in C++. They asked me why we create a ".h" or ".hpp" file in c++.
Why do we write "#ifdef" and "#ifndef" in those files?
What is "cout" in C++?
What is my opinion on which is better C++ or Python?

Base : 10.5 LPA
Location : Hyderabad
The online test consisted of MCQs and had three sections. The topics in the technical section covered the basics of C/ C++ and OOP concepts. Questions were mostly output based. The aptitude section was a bit time consuming but not very difficult. There were some OS questions as well. In the third section, we could choose between hardware or software. I chose the software section.
I had 3 rounds in total, the first two being technical and the last one HR. They had shortlisted around 80 people for the software profile and the interview process was really time-consuming. 
For the first round, the interviewer was pretty chill. He didn't ask me much on OS or DBMS. He asked me a lot about C/C++ basics and a bit on memory management. Many of my friends were asked a lot on OS and DBMS. I was also asked some basic coding questions like string reversal and a modification of it. The interviewer asked me about Qualcomm and its products. So reading about the company and their products before the interview is a really good idea. I was also asked questions from my resume
The second round was a really long one compared to the first one. It was almost 1 hour and 15 mins. The interview started with a probability question.
The question was:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-12-maximize-probability-of-white-ball/
Then he moved on to coding questions. Most questions were based on bit manipulation. He asked me around 3-4 questions from that topic and luckily I was able to answer all of them. Most questions were similar to the ones I had gone through on that topic. Then he asked me a question which I solved using stack.
The question was:
Given a continuous input stream of integers, find the maximum at any instance.
I was again asked a modification of that. 
The last round was the HR round. She asked almost all the cliche questions (Tell about yourself. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? Do you plan to go for higher studies? What motivates you in life? A challenging situation I had to deal with, etc.) Be prepared for these kinds of questions.
The job profile is associate engineer and the job location is Hyderabad. They selected around 20 people in the software profile.
Interviewbit,Geeksforgeeks, and Leetcode are really good platforms for practicing coding and probability questions. Practice writing code in paper and think out loud. Interviewers assess you through your thought process. Make sure that your resume is crisp and to the point. And also have a clear idea of whatever you have written in it.

<athi6028@gmail.com>
CTC: 14 LPA
Base: 12 LPA
Online Round:
The first round was an online coding test on Hackerrank. There were 2 questions. One was a string manipulation question, and the other was Sudoku solving (backtracking). There were no questions on aptitude. 
Technical Rounds:
For the interview, there were 3 rounds - 2 technical and 1 HR. In the first round, I was asked to write the pseudocode for the deep copy function in Java. I didn’t know what deep copy was, so I had to first understand it by discussing it with the interviewer. Then, I was asked to design a lift management system. I had to make an object-oriented design and then write the code for it. Then, there was a detailed discussion about my internship project, after which questions related to it were asked. 
The second round was longer. He asked me about the Operating Systems Lab course I had taken. I was asked to explain the whole project, and also write code for a few system calls. This was a fairly detailed discussion, so make sure you know all the projects on your resume well. Questions on multithreading and how it is implemented were asked. Then he gave me a puzzle to solve. 
HR Round : 
The third round was the HR round. I was asked the typical HR question: ‘Why this company?’.Then I was asked about my previous internship, and the challenges I faced then. I was asked about my choice of the job location. Then I was told about the CTC split up and if I was okay with that. I asked a few doubts I had about the CTC split up. This round was pretty chill for me. 
At the end of each round, I was asked if I had questions for them. I asked questions based on what I heard during the PPT session before the interview. The kind of questions you ask can help in making an impression, so make it count! 
2 students were selected at the end.
TIPS:
1. Focus on your coding skills well. Sharpen your Data Structures and Algorithms (especially Dynamic Programming, Greedy, Backtracking) knowledge during the vacations.
 2. Utilize the summer vacations to the maximum. Practice coding and aptitude questions. Also brush up on whatever you learned in your OS, DBMS, Networks classes. 
3. Stay calm and be confident during the interviews. Make yourself comfortable with the whole process by conducting mock interviews with friends.
 4. Don’t panic or let yourself down after rejection from a company. The important thing is to assess what went wrong and work on those issues. 
All the best!

CGPA cutoff: 7.00
Stipend: Rs.50,000/-
Online round:
This was conducted on Hacker Rank. There were two coding questions(both can be found on geeksforgeeks).
The first one was for 40 marks. In this question, we were asked to find the winner of an election where an array of names of candidates in an election was given.
The second question was for 60 marks and comparatively tough too. This was based on Dynamic Programming, named as “Weighted Job Scheduling”.
56 students were shortlisted for the next rounds.
Technical round 1:
The interviewer was very friendly and made me feel comfortable before the actual process of the interview. He first asked for my introduction and then introduced himself. I was asked questions related to my resume then he asked the following DSA questions:
1.Evaluation of prefix expression with an example
2.Regarding recursion
3.Tower of Hanoi
For each question, I was asked to write the pseudocode. While answering questions related to Tower of Hanoi I got stuck, so he helped me. After these questions, he asked me general questions about machine learning and then asked me if I had any questions, so I asked about how he found JPMC different from other companies(as while introducing himself he listed many companies where he had worked before joining JPMC).
Technical round 2:
The interviewer asked me about my strengths and weaknesses. Then he started asking me questions like which coding platform I use, my favorite data structure, etc. He asked me to tell everything I knew about AVL trees and write pseudo code for insertion and deletion and explain how that code retains the AVL tree property. He also asked two following puzzles and I was able to answer both of them.
Using 4 minutes and 7 minutes sand timers, measure 8 mins, 9 mins, 10 mins.
There are 4 persons(say A, B, C, and D) who want to cross a bridge. A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge. B takes 2 minutes, C takes 7 minutes and D takes 12 minutes to cross the same bridge. There is only one torch with them and the bridge can not be crossed without the torch. Also, there can be at most 2 persons on the bridge at any time. The total time taken by two to cross the bridge is measured by the time taken by the slower person. Calculate min time taken to cross the bridge.
11 students were shortlisted for the HR round.
HR round:
He asked me to introduce myself and then asked about my strengths and weaknesses. As I did my schooling in north India, he asked me about the difficulties I faced in NITC (language, food). Then he asked about my passion apart from anything related to academics, why I chose to be a computer science student, my motivation to do anything, etc. Then he asked me why I didn't do any project, so I explained that the projects I did were part of the ML course and were basic so I didn't mention those.
In the end, he asked me if I had any questions, so I asked about Pymetrics(how they decide based on that)
7 students were selected and were given the opportunity to work with JPMC, and I was one of them.
Tips:
Be very specific while answering.
Before going for an interview, get to know about the company and read interview experiences.
Brush up on your basics
You should put only those stuff in the resume which you know.
While solving a problem, talk through your thought process.

CGPA cut-off: 7.00
Stipend: Rs.50,000/-
Branches allowed: CSE, ECE, EEE
Online Round :
The online round was a coding round with no aptitude or technical questions. It had 2 questions, one for 40 marks and another for 60 marks. The total time given was 1 hour. The contest was hosted on Hackerrank.
The first question was an easy question, to decide the result of an election. The votes cast by n people were given as input, which was a string array whose ith element was the name of the person for whom the ith person cast the vote. The person with the maximum number of votes was the winner and in case of a tie, the person with the largest number of votes and alphabetically greatest should be the answer.
The second question was relatively tough(as usual), and based on Dynamic Programming. It was a very famous "Weighted Job Scheduling" problem. Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling/
The toughness of the question lied in the fact that the entire test case is a string, so you had to first convert all the required things to integers and then solve it, which was difficult considering the time-limit of 1 hour.
Anyone who solved at least one problem was shortlisted for the next round. Around 56 students were shortlisted like this.
There were 2 technical rounds and the last one was HR Round(as usual).
Technical Round 1:
It was a relatively tougher round for me than other rounds, as the interviewer was a bit strict. First, he asked me to introduce myself while he went through my resume. I had written HTML and CSS in my resume. So he asked questions based on CSS first.
 
Q1) What is a selector ?
Q2) What are the various ways of using CSS in an HTML page?
Since I didn't know JavaScript, he was not very impressed and said that HTML and CSS without JavaScript are of no use.
Q3) What are the new features in HTML 5?
He was also not impressed by the fact that I had no projects on my resume. He asked me the reason, to which I told that I did competitive programming during my summers and brushed up my DSA skills. So I couldn’t do a project. And finally, to cover this fact, I told him about the ongoing Operating Systems Project(expos NITC) I was doing. He asked a few questions about the project like what was expos(the name of my OS project) and what I was doing in that. I told him what I knew about it.
He asked me 1-2 questions on OOPS concepts.
After a few questions on relatively weak topics of mine, he came to Data Structures and Algorithms. It was only then that I relaxed for a while.
He asked me about the data structures I knew. Since I had implemented a lot of data structures in my DSA and program design lab, I could answer the question.
He then asked me a question on doubly linked list.
Ques: Find the nth node from the end in a doubly-linked list. The trick in the question was that length of the linked list was not provided and only a single traversal was allowed.
Ans : (Link to answer: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/)
Next, he asked me some basic questions on stack, queues, and some time complexity related problems.
He then asked about the sorting algorithms I knew. I told all the sorting algorithms. After that, he asked me to tell the difference between Merge Sort and Quick Sort. I answered in a little more detail than he expected :P.
The last question was the easiest one.
Ques: Check if a string is a palindrome or not. ( Cakewalk question, very easy).
In the end, he asked me if I had any questions for him, to which I asked: What are the topics an intern should try to learn if he/she joins JP Morgan Chase?
Technical Round 2:
It was a relatively easier round for me.
This round was taken by a senior member of the recruitment team. He was very generous and greeted me warmly. He went through my resume and asked me to introduce myself meanwhile.
He asked me what all data structures I had implemented. I told him all the data structures I had implemented( Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, tree, graphs, etc). He thought I was comfortable in all these data structures so he asked me about all the algorithms I had implemented in graphs. I told all those, after which he asked about the Bellman-Ford Algorithm. I explained it to him very clearly and he seemed to be impressed by it. Later, he asked me to code in one of my favorite languages. Initially, I tried to code, but later told him that I was not comfortable with graphs. He said ok and asked me some questions on trees.
He asked me to explain AVL tree and to insert elements from 1-10 into a tree. I answered very clearly and later started coding it. One benefit was, I was asked to assume certain built-in functions like the height of the tree, etc. 
After that, he asked me 2 puzzles.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-1-how-to-measure-45-minutes-using-two-identical-wires/
https://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/weighing-10-bags-solution.html
I answered both, and the round was over.
11 Students made it to the HR round and I was one of them.
HR Round : 
The HR round was very easy. He asked me to introduce myself and asked how Kerala and NIT Calicut was. After talking for a while, he again asked me why I didn't do any project. I tried to explain to him the reason (it being competitive programming). Next, he asked me how I overcame my communication barrier as I was from the north. After that, he asked if I knew any Malayalam word. I told him that the only word I learned was "Malayalam ariyilla" which meant "I don’t know Malayalam":p.
And after a few more questions, the round was over.
Finally, after 12 hours of a long and highly tiring process, the result was announced and 7 students were selected.
Tips :
Prepare well for subjects like Data Structures and Algorithms and Computer Organization. Since they are the only core subjects for a second-year student, the questions for internships are bound to come from these two only.
Practice, Practice, and Practice more.
Practice a lot of questions, and try to do competitive programming regularly. This will make the interview questions very easy for you. A lot of my friends got an internship entirely based on competitive programming.
For exclusively interview-based questions, practice on Leetcode and Interviewbit.
"Look into basic concepts of OOPS"(Important). 
Don't write anything in your resume you are not confident about. Be thorough about your resume. Just because you want your resume to be "Bhara Bhara", do not write anything which you don’t know. You will eventually get caught and it won't make a good impression.
It's okay to not know some of the questions they ask. What they see is your effort on the problems, so after trying for a while, if you don't know, just be honest and tell that you don’t know the answer.
Finally, try to do a project, be it any project like course project, a project from GeeksForGeeks, etc.  Projects link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-projects/
All the best!!!

CGPA cut-off: 7.00
Stipend: Rs.50,000/-
Branches allowed: CSE, ECE, EEE
Internship Duration: 10 weeks
JPMC visited our campus for Full time and Internship opportunity.
There were a total of 4 rounds including the coding round. 
Round 1: Online Coding Round
The online coding test was hosted on Hackerrank platform. There were only 2 coding questions and time duration of 1 hour.
Question 1 :(40 Marks)
It was a simple hashmap question in which you have given a vector of strings and we have to return the string which has the maximum occurrence and if the occurrences of some of the strings are the same then we have to return the lexicographically greater string.
Question 2 :(60 Marks)
It was a famous "Weighted Job Scheduling" problem.
Given N jobs where every job is represented by following three elements of it.
    1)Start Time
    2)Finish Time
    3)Profit or Value Associated
Find the maximum profit subset of jobs such that no two jobs in the subset overlap.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/weighted-job-scheduling/
Anyone who solved at least one problem was shortlisted for the next round.
A total of 50 students were shortlisted for the next round. 
Round 2: Technical Round 1
This round started with my Course Project on Verilog (CPU Design) as I had mentioned in my resume. He asked me to explain the project and the working in it.
  After explaining the project he gave me a simple question: 
Given a linked list, check if the linked list has a loop or not.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/
I gave him a solution and then he asked me to write the code on the paper and explain it with the test case he gave me after providing the solution and explanation he told me to modify the solution to remove the loop from the list, after the modification I provided the solution and he was looking satisfied with the approach.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-and-remove-loop-in-a-linked-list/
This was a famous problem "Stock Buy-sell to Maximize Profit".
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/
First I gave him a solution with the worst time complexity of O(N^2) that is brute force solution after that he asked me to optimize it, I tried solving it with the pre-built data structures in STL(Standard Template Library) using (sorting of vector pair) which solves the problem in time complexity of O(NlogN) then he told me to write the code on the paper after writing the code he started asking me how do I get familiar with STL library than I told him I am doing competitive programming from more than a year and there I get to use with the data structures. He was pretty impressed with the approach but not fully satisfied with the solution as it reaching the complexity of O(NlogN) as asked me further to optimize it more or do I have a solution to solve it in O(N), I tried solving it but unfortunately I couldn't provide the solution with the best complexity that is O(N).
After the round was finished I asked him, What kind of Projects I can expect during my Internship Process and the coding languages we must be familiar with.
Luckily I got selected for the next round.
Round 3: Technical Round 2
Again, this round started with my course project, I explained to him thoroughly. After that, he asked me what all data structures I had studied in my course and I  told him
Arrays, linked lists, Graphs (BFS, DFS, Prims, Kruskal, Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford and Floyd Warshall) he asked me if I am comfortable with all the algorithms, so I told him, yes, then he asked me if I am comfortable with Bellman-Ford and asked me to write the code on the paper, So I first explained the algorithm and why we do not prefer Dijkstra's as it has the better time complexity comparatively with Bellman-Ford. After writing the code on the paper I explained to him the complexity of Bellman-Ford as well as the running of it on a test case, and he was pretty satisfied with the explanation.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-simple-implementation/
Then he asked me some basic puzzles and gave me nearly 5-10 minutes to solve them.
1) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/forums/topic/measuring-45-minutes-using-two-identical-wires/
2) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/
There were a total of 11 students including me shortlisted for the HR Round.
Round 4: HR Round    
This round was very chill as compared to other rounds, no complexity bounds, no test cases nothing at all, you just had to share your experience, but still, this round also started with my course project like other rounds. As I have mentioned Coding Platforms and Ratings on some of the platforms, so he asked me a bit about CP(Competitive Programming). After that, he asked me about my family background.
CHAT(INTERVIEWER AND ME)
Interviewer: What are your hobbies?
Interviewer: Tell me something about your experiences living in Kerala and the places that you visited?
Interviewer: How is the MESS FOOD in College?
Me: "It's Terrible"
Interviewer: How did you manage this kind of food?
Me: Canteens and the restaurants around our campus are the only reason for our survival "Smokey's" had played a major role in it
Interviewer: Who is your idol?
Well, I felt during the interview that my answer to this question made a good impression on the interviewer.   
First of all, make sure that you are thorough with the stuff that you have written in your resume. The interviewer will ask questions from that only. If you are unable to explain something that you mentioned in your resume that won't make a good impression.
Secondly, be thorough with all the topics in DSA, Time Complexities for all the algorithms involved. Geeksforgeeks is useful for Interview Questions but you need to clear the round before for that. Try to do coding regularly, On platforms like(Codechef, Codeforces, Hackerrank, Spoj) any of these you are comfortable with.  
I hope my experience will help you to get prepared for your Internship. 
All the Best!!!

Total CTC - 3150000 INR
Location: Bangalore
CGPA Cut-Off: 7.5 
Round 1 (Online) :
This round was hosted on Hackerrank. It consisted of 5 sections with 3 coding questions(2 basic, 1 advanced), 20 MCQs on quantitave aptitude, probability, DSA, DBMS, and 2 subjective questions(HR type). The models of coding questions were :
1. https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/equal/problem
2. Interval Partitioning Problem in http://athena.nitc.ac.in/~kmurali/Courses/Algos15A/interval.pdf
3. Coin Change Problem Modification.
MCQs were not direct but will test your analytic skills.
Around 19 members from Btech, Mtech, MCA were shortlisted.
Round 2 (F2F Interview) :
As soon as I entered the room, the Interviewer gave a math question.
1. Find the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number.
I started with a naive approach and then proceeded with the optimized version to prevent the overflow for the bigger numbers. Then he asked me to write code along with time complexity. Though I took some time, I could complete it.
Then he went on posing the next question dramatically as follows
2. Given a stream of characters, Can you give me the most efficient algorithm with the best data structure to store, with the least time and space complexity so that at any point of time, I have to retrieve the list of words and their counts in the best possible way in a lexicographical order.
I started to take each bit of the question at a time and eliminate the alternatives to conclude to use a Trie data structure. (I didn't know much about trie at that point but I just know what a trie is, which I had come across in some interview experience). After some time, I could devise an algorithm and explained it to him. He gave me a few lengthy test cases to dry run. This proved to be crucial for me (as I could figure out a few errors in my logic and included them by modifying on the spot). Finally, I am done with all cases but he wasn't.
He asked me casually whether I could write the complete working code. I moved on to ask him the things I can assume, and after getting clarified with all the minor details, I have completed the code along with comments wherever necessary, the time complexity for each function I made use of. He was very happy with my approach.
3. How will you convince a stubborn employee to work with you to complete an important project in GS?
I told him that I would convince him by elucidating the pros and benefits if we work together and cons if we don't. He was putting me under stress with the same question asking 3-4 times that still he won't listen to you. I still managed to add a few more points. But, he decided to grill me again and again with the same question. Being fed up, I gave a sarcastic answer "I don't think Goldman Sachs will hire such a foolish employee". He laughed and told me that he was satisfied with my brave answer.
4. What are your Strengths and Weaknesses?
"My strength and weakness is my failure". I gave him some time to get amazed. Then he asked me the reason. I had my justification with my hard and fruitful experiences. He was super impressed.
Few HR type questions which I don't remember, but they were testing how we react and respond in a critical situation.
"Great and realistic. You seem to have a different kind of mindset which is pretty cool". This was the compliment he gave at the end of the round.
Then I asked a few questions which I prepared during the PPT.
In Goldman Sachs University(GSU), What kind of courses do you offer to learn?. What kind of measures do you take in terms of the personality development of an employee?
Round 3 (Panel Interview):
Tell me about yourself?
I made up a short story about myself that includes everything about me beforehand itself, so that was the easiest part.
2. Level Order Traversal variation (some twist in zigzag order. If you know zigzag traversal, you can do it with ease).
The same pattern as above was followed. Explaining the logic and then writing the complete working code.
After the completion of code, both of them tried to confuse me with the use of stack and queues while tracing some edge cases but since I had a clear discussion before writing the code itself, I reminded them and just gave them a hint that I could rewrite the code in the other way too, but it would result in same time complexity. They seem to be convinced.
3. Given N ( number of nodes), find the number of unique BSTs possible with N nodes. (Dynamic Programming)
Initially, we discussed the DP concept on why we need it, how could it solve our problem. Then after some time, I had taken a small example and was trying to figure out the recursive solution, optimal substructure. Time is running.... but I didn't get a clear thought. This was the testing time for me. They stopped me and divided the question and asked me to do each part. After solving a few parts, they asked me to generalize it. Again I got stuck and was feeling nervous. They observed that and made me relax for a few minutes. This break did relieve my stress, provided me enough time to reconstruct the solution within no time. The funny part is they were happier than me when I arrived at the solution.
They said they were done with me and encouraged me to ask questions if I had any.
I felt I wasn't up to the mark. Without hesitation, I told them that they haven't had a look at my resume, projects, and internship which I feel like my strong points. Then they gave me a chance to discuss the intern experience.
4. Internship Experience: I had an Intern Presentation meeting few days before with the North American team during the end of my internship where I had to represent my Chennai team, discuss and detail the project, I had taken up. This helped a lot and I discussed the same things here as well. They asked me a few questions whether it is deployed or not ?, What's the duration of your project?, What did you learn apart from technical skills, etc.. I could answer them connecting with the situations I had and what I did during that time, rather than boasting with few sound words.
I asked a few company-related questions like opportunities, career growth, etc., Interviewer's journey with GS till now and their learning curves after joining GS.
Round 4 (Crazy Round) :
All those who cleared previous rounds were called into a room where we were expected to have a Group discussion but they canceled the round on purpose.
They started the discussion saying "All the people in the room were good throughout the interview process and few of you are eliminated with an inch closer. All the best !!"
Now, I started to feel tense and more worried because there were very few in the room along with MTech people, MCA people, and that too GS hadn't recruited any Btech students for the last few years.
Surprisingly, the next line was "ALL OF YOU ARE IN, WELCOME TO GOLDMAN SACHS". They have already decided before this round itself, it was just created for excitement. They informed us to get our passports ready (since our Orientation can be in New York :) )
That was the most emotional and happiest moment of my life. Tears started to depart from my eyes as I have just arrived in my dream company.
Tips and Facts :
Self-confidence is the key. Believe in yourself, work hard, and don't believe in luck because hard work always works harder than luck.
CGPA matters, but it doesn't matter. CGPA matters in the eligibility criteria so it's important to maintain above 7/7.5. After getting shortlisted, it doesn't matter. If you have decent CGPA, have good knowledge on a few subjects, and some cool projects to talk about, then you are no less to a 9 pointer guy.
Sit for a day and prepare for the basic HR questions with your ideas and the words you speak should have proof in the form of your experiences.
Always be prepared to face the difficult and different questions. Say you've solved some 100 questions on Geeksforgeeks/Hackerrank, you shouldn't go to the interview expecting one of the questions to come. If you go in that way, your intensity to solve a new problem will not be that high. So always study the concepts clearly and analyze the ideas while solving problems so that these will help in analyzing the new questions.
Don't worry if you are not doing an internship / if you got an intern in a small company with less stipend. If you are doing some quality work or some good project, then you are on par with the guy with a good internship. ( Even I was feeling low when I got an intern in a small company while my friends got into a few good companies in Bangalore. At the end of the day, I am the first person to get placed in our batch.) So don't underestimate small companies they've got good projects to work on, to learn a lot.
No one is going to get success overnight but all your ideas and efforts can pile up and bring success overnight. (If you didn't perform well in 3rd-year intern interviews and tests, work on the things you made wrong and rectify them. All the work you do at this time will reflect during 4th-year Placements).
After Placement :
Don't be proud. Help your friends in preparing a good resume, explaining a few concepts/projects in which you are strong.
Interact with them frequently, Interview them if possible to let them realize their mistakes in prior. Remind them of their capacity and make them feel confident if they are feeling low and help them to get placed.
HARD WORK ALWAYS PAYS OFF!

Online Preliminary Round:
HackerRank platform was the medium used to conduct this round with a time duration of 2 hours.
This round contained three coding questions. The first was a straight forward and fundamental question based on Arrays. The second one was a bit difficult, which was an incomprehensible one where I could get only 40% of the test cases to work correctly. And the third one was a difficult question based on dynamic programming, which I wasn't able to solve.
The next round was full of usual problem solving and probability questions, which I answered at the expense of 45 minutes. There were ten questions, and 12th-grade math concepts were sufficient to answer them.
Apart from these two types of questions, there was an HR-related question asking about real-life problems we faced and how we overcame that.
What helped me crack this round?
During the summer vacation, I tried solving a few questions from the interview preparation kit in HackerRank. This practice helped me brush up my coding skills, and I would recommend that you try out problem-solving questions from this or any other platforms available. A little brush-up of probability we learned in high school would also help a lot in the aptitude round.
PS: If you could focus on Dynamic Programming questions, that'll be help a lot.
After the coding test, a total of 15 of us got selected for the interview.
First Round:
The interviewer was pretty chill. She asked me basic data structure questions in the first round, like how to sort a singly linked list recursively and non-recursively. She also asked me questions related to HashTable and Dictionaries. Whenever I got stuck trying to explain the concept, she was accommodating and suggested I give examples instead of definitions.
Second Round:
In the second round, the person who interviewed me asked me about the extracurricular activities I was a part of. He then asked me a primary relative velocity based question and, after that, a very common puzzle. Then he asked an HR-related question. After which he asked me a DSA related question based on HashMap.
What helped me crack these two rounds?
Revising DSA lecture notes were helpful. The questions will mostly be based on the topics covered in the course. Proper communication, I was able to convey the thoughts I had on how I'l approach the given question properly, with the interviewer. Before coming up with the algorithm, I explained how I would solve the problem and any alternative ideas I had. Also, being able to ask questions about the company and the project we'd be working on made them understand I was interested in the company.
The overall duration of the interview was very less compared to some other companies.
And the results were announced 2 hours later.
There are a few other things which I felt, in general, will help you a lot during the process.
First of all, don't let the process take a toll on you. You might get tensed but always remain calm. Trust yourself and be confident.
Do not panic during the coding tests. Read the question correctly and take time and solve them. Try your best to get at least a minimum number of test cases correct. Answer as many questions as you, and if there are no negative marks, try to answer all the MCQs.
When the Pre-placement talk occurs, listen to it carefully and ask doubts so they can understand you are interested in the job.
Ensure you have a clean resume, do not exaggerate and try to add only the necessary details about your projects, work interests, and extracurricular activities.
If you do not know the answer to a question, try conveying them with the knowledge you have on the topic, and if you are done, tell that you have a piece of limited knowledge on that topic. Remember, it's better to say to them that you are not familiar with the topic than to answer it incorrectly.
The main aim is to get the interviewer interested in you and to leave a good impression. Be smart and active. Avoid long gaps of silence that could occur when you are devoted to writing the algorithm for the problem or coming up with a solution for the puzzle given to you in the interview and communicate what you are thinking about the approach for the solution.
Remember, it's all about having the right mindset when you sit for the interview. Feel free to ping me if you have any other queries regarding the interview or the internship at Goldman Sachs.
Good luck!

Place of Posting: Bangalore
CTC (lakhs): 31.50
CGPA cut-off: 7.00
Goldman Sachs is a global investment banking, securities, and investment management firm. It was one of the first companies to visit the college.
Online Test
The test was divided into sections-Mathematics, Computer Science and Programming. They had already informed us about the topics on which candidates will be tested.
"Mathematics: probability and statistics, differential equations, time series analysis, Monte Carlo methods, data mining, machine learning, regression, and other numerical techniques.
Computer Science: strong fundamentals in distributed systems, databases, design and analysis of algorithms, implementation of programming languages, and run-time systems.
Knowledge of finance, stochastic calculus, and financial models is not required. "
Questions were based on these topics. There were also two programming questions - one was a simple array manipulation question that most of us were able to solve. The second was a variation of the coin change problem.
19 of us were shortlisted. Then there were two rounds of face to face interviews.
Round 1:
My first interviewer was an alumnus from our college. In fact, he had interviewed me last year when I applied for an internship. He went through my resume and we talked about the courses I had taken so far and my interests. We also talked about my internship experience. Then he asked me only one coding question.
Array Implementation of BST.
Students were again shortlisted after round 1.
Round 2:
My second interviewer directly jumped into questions.
He asked about the programming languages I am comfortable with. I had mainly worked with C and C++. He tested me on the syntax of some common STL containers in C++. He asked how much memory would be allotted for an empty struct and the reason behind it. He also asked about the various methods of memory allocation in both C++ and C.
He asked me to give me the logic of the following programming question.
Find the Excel column name from a given column number
I had taken compilers lab last semester and had mentioned that in resume. He asked me in detail about the various stages that a compiler does.
Finally, he asked me to write the code for BFS or DFS.
In the end, a total of 6 were selected out of which 3 were BTech students.
Some things I would like to add:
Pay attention to the documents that the company provides: For the online test I had prepared from the syllabus that they had provided. This helped me to tackle the questions faster.
Code using pen and paper: Most of the interviewers expect you to write compilable code in a face to face interview rounds.
Solve previous interview questions: The same questions might not repeat but you will get an overall idea of the pattern and the toughness level of the interview. I mainly prepared from geeksforgeeks. InterviewBit is another fun site where they create a virtual interview environment. Going through interview diaries also helped.
Practice solving puzzles: Even though I was not asked any, many of the others faced such questions.
Reflect on the online test before going for the face to face interviews: The interviewer tends to ask about improvisations for the programming questions from the online test.
CGPA matters: I was told that students were shortlisted after the online test based on both how they did in the online test as well as their CGPA.
Talk out loud: Interviewers like to hear your thought process and will help if you get stuck somewhere.
Research about the company: Asking valid questions during the PPT will make you stand out from the rest of the crowd. Also, prepare questions for the interviewers well in advance.
Don't stress a lot: When I was first shortlisted I was second from the bottom in the list. Added to this was the fact that I had just returned from my internship and hence was not at all prepared to sit for placements. I was scared that I will not be able to perform well in the interviews. But the interviewers do consider that when they consider you.
Be honest: I was already informed that I will not be receiving a PPO from my internship. The interviewers asked me about the reasons for not receiving one. I was quite frank with my experience.
I hope this article has been useful. All the best for your placements!

As far as online rounds are considered,it mostly revolves around coding, aptitude and maths.
The partition of these depends on the company's needs. For me, it was Goldman Sachs which being a finance company focused almost equally in all these areas. Probability was the one they focused more from maths while for coding they gave beginner and advanced level questions.
Now moving onto the interview, it was not as stressful as I thought it would be, because the officials were friendly. It was divided into 3 rounds which mostly dealt with our aptitude and coding skills. Most of them asked a question in C/C++ ,and asked me to write the code. And then they asked a logical/aptitude type question.
It's important to note that ,even if you don't know the answer just give them something that shows how you are tackling the problem and how far you have reached with it.
Now it's important to make a resume that showcases those skills that the company is searching for in an intern. And make sure that you know in depth about those areas. Also make a study on the company's profile and structure your answer so as to coincide their needs with your wants. Also beware of HR questions like "what are your strengths","what do you expect from us", "why do we have to select you as an intern instead of the rest of your friends" and so on. And keep in mind to have a pleasant composure all the way through. Also just to repeat, a well made resume is a halfway ticket to a company (which doesn't mean you have to stuff it with something you are not).
And good luck to you guys...

Online Round
Straightforward round with two coding questions, based on string manipulation and array handling. I solved the string manipulation one, which was enough to get selected. Brush up on dynamic programming for sure.
Technical Interview 1
The interview started on an informal note. The interviewer was a NITC alumnus and we had a small chat on the current happenings in the campus.
To start the interview, I was asked many basic questions on data structures. They were along the lines of rearranging linked lists, handling heaps, and then writing a recursive function to print the Fibonacci series. After this, I was asked about the two earlier internships I had listed in my resume. It involved working with databases among other things. I was then asked to design a database for a food-delivery service like Swiggy. The rough problem goes like this: the determination of all the stakeholders was left up to me but the one stakeholder that the question specified was the delivery partner. The delivery partner can recruit other delivery partners in a manner resembling a pyramid scheme. A percentage of the profits made by the delivery partner would also reach the partner who had recruited them. It took me around three attempts to arrive at a working theory for the database.
Each of the attempts had me explaining my thought process out loud to the interviewer until I arrived at an interim answer. The interviewer would then point to a flaw in my design, at which point I would confidently state that that could be solved. The interviewer was very helpful and nudged me along at places I got stuck at. This is why explaining your thought process, and playing the confidence card smartly is crucial. This is only if you are slightly weak on the technical side like me of course.
After the database question, I was asked aptitude-like questions in coding, mostly along the lines of ‘what data type you would use here’, and other basic questions. In all certainty, this round was only to eliminate the very technically weak candidates.
Technical Interview 2
This round had the interviewer go straight for the gut. My first question had two arrays that were to be merged and sorted, subject to some conditions. To buy time, I put forth a suggestion after two minutes of thinking, which was rejected of course. After a further two minutes, I was able to get the answer. 
The second question was to design a full program using OOPS concepts. I forgot the premise of the question. Anyway, I stuck to the basics; I did all the encapsulating I could and threw in some polymorphisms. Since there wasn’t a single right answer to this, the interviewer’s face would light up every time I explained why I did a certain something and how it’s a good object-oriented practice to do so.
The third question had me gasping for air. It was also OOPS-related but I forget the exact question. I still look back in wonderment at how the interviewer actually helped me through with every step to arrive at the solution.
This was followed by your run-of-the-mill aptitude questions involving candles and ropes, dividing L-shaped figures into four equal parts, etc.
Last but not least, the interviewer asked me if I had any questions for her. I asked her about the work culture at SAP and her experience working there. A joke or two was thrown in from my part (not recommended) that had the interviewer grow more warm and cheerful as the interview progressed. I would say these are also important points in your conversation that helps the other person form an impression about you. We talked on decidedly non-technical matters on the interviewer’s professional life for a full half-hour. I remember leaving the room thinking to myself that even if I didn’t make the cut later, I had at least had an enlightening conversation.
10 students were shortlisted after 2 rounds of technical interviews.
HR Interview
It was pretty late when my turn to get interviewed came, so I was kind of taken aback when after the initial chit chat, no real questions were asked. Only the ones you would expect. Perhaps they weren’t looking to eliminate any more candidates, which turned out to be the case later on. 
Nevertheless to better seal my chances, I capitalized the moment I was asked if I had any questions for the interviewer. I presented my understanding of the SAP world which I had obtained from various sources prior to the interviews and asked her if they held any merit. From that point on, I was again able to strike up a good conversation with the interviewer. Both of us left the interview with a genuine smile on our faces, which I think is all that an HR round of interview is for.
If you have made it this far, I would like to relate an incident where my friend from another college got eliminated after she got to the HR round. She was asked why she would like to join company ABC, to which she replied with ‘who wouldn’t want to join ABC’. My friend swears that the interviewer’s expression soured at her tone and/or words, and later she was shocked to find out that they hadn’t selected her. So, take what lessons you will from that.
Overall, the interviewers from SAP who had visited us were quite pleasant people and I couldn’t have hoped for a better first recruitment experience. All 10 students were selected.

Stipend: 80k per month
Duration: 8 weeks
Like the past 2 years, Microsoft didn't directly visit our campus for recruitment. Instead, we had to participate in an off-campus drive the news about which was circulated in the T&P groups (but I had come to know about this opening before this through LinkedIn. Some people from Microsoft had posted on LinkedIn asking for resumes and were looking forward to referring some candidates. I was lucky to get referred by one such person from Microsoft.)
Online coding round
There were 3 questions, the time allotted was 90 mins.
The questions in this round were easy to moderate. Covering topics like sorting, searching, string manipulation, and priority queues.
Only the people to solve all three questions qualify for the next round.
A few weeks later I received a mail informing me that I had cleared the coding round and an online one on one interview has been scheduled for me.
Online interview
The interviewer asked about me and made me feel comfortable and at ease. He also introduced himself and talked about the nature of the work he does at Microsoft.
Then he moved on to the questions and asked me, given a pre-order traversal of a BST, is it possible to construct the BST from it. I was a bit nervous then and said that a unique BST construction was not possible. Then he asked me to draw 2 different BSTs for a pre-order traversal. I quickly realized my mistake and told him that yes a unique BST could be constructed. I was then told to write compilable code in a notepad window for the same. This had been done multiple times by me as a part of DSA lab so I wrote down the recursive code for this pretty quickly. He asked me to explain through my code and asked a few cross-questions. He seemed satisfied.
Then for the next question, he asked if I was comfortable with bit masking. I was not sure so I said no, but also told that I would be happy to try. I don’t remember the question exactly, (since I'm writing this article long after the interviews were conducted) but I was not sure of any good solution so I explained to him and coded a brute force solution. He didn't seem very satisfied and then gave me some hints using which I made my solution better, but I think still there was a better solution possible. He still was not completely contended, but as we were running out of time. He decided to conclude up the coding part and asked about any projects that I have done recently and any problems that I have faced and how I overcame it. I talked about the expOS lab project and how we had to patiently hunt for bugs in that (folks who are about to go for OS lab will feel me :P, I found it to be one of the most awesome lab courses at NITC). Then, I asked him some questions related to the nature of the work and what keeps him excited to work there. With that, the interview concluded.
A few days later I was communicated that I had qualified for the onsite round in Hyderabad. But the schedule clashed with my end-semester exams, and after a lot of requests, they were considerate enough to reschedule this round. The updated location was Gurgaon.
Onsite Rounds
[around 50 people from different colleges were there].
We were informed that there will be a group fly round followed by interview loops and that each round would be an elimination round.
Group Fly Round
It is the group fly round where most of the eliminations occur.
In the group fly round we were arranged in groups of 7-10 in different rooms and given a question paper with questions, We had 1 hour to write down the answers. (Don't get misled by the name.. candidates are required to solve through the questions individually on their own. No teamwork here :P).
Each room had 1-2 mentors or guides with whom you must clarify any doubts regarding the question paper and talk to if you are unsure. [tip: always try to interact more and more with the mentor(s) in your room, it is also believed that they keep observing approaches of each candidate and their feedback is also important in the results of this round].
The question paper that I received for group fly was quite different from what I had expected (based on the interview experiences I had read online). I expected the paper to have only 1-2 questions for which we would be expected to write code and test cases. But the paper that I received had some questions related to combinatorics & probability. Then there were a few questions about a C++ code snippet that was given. Some questions related to bitwise shifts & operations with a catch of integer overflow [tip:  there might not exist an exact answer for every question. You must write whatever approach you have]. Then there was a question based on regex matching, in which a fixed pattern was given and we had to output the indices in the input string which matched with the fixed pattern. The key here to write a good solution was to observe that the nature of the pattern which was given made it possible to solve in linear time. Then there was another coding question that I'm describing next.  List of meetings scheduled for 2 employees(not with each other) in 24 hrs was given as time slots (Ex: 1015hrs to 1230 hrs). The time was only counted in 15-minute slots starting from 0000, then 0015, 0030, 0045, and so on. Now, these two employees had to schedule a contiguous meeting with each other and this could be done only in the time slots in which they both are free. The task was to output the start and end time of any longest such slot possible. The twist was that each of them is free to cancel at max one of their meetings if the duration of that meeting is less than 30 mins. Now the time left at hand for me was too little to think about a proper solution, so I quickly started writing down a very naive solution, but as the time ran out, I couldn't complete a small part of it.
Answer sheets were collected and we were told that we will be informed about the results of this round after 1hr but eventually ended up taking 2hrs (which felt like a lot longer at that moment). I was sure that I would not be going forward and was a bit disappointed with how I performed in the group-fly. Meanwhile, I heard a lot of candidates talk about how awesome their test went. (I had mentally prepared myself to leave at this point of time). They finally revealed the results of the group fly round. Around 25 candidates were told that they were done for the day. around 15 were sent out in different rooms with different interviewers for the first round of one on one interviews. The rest of us were told to wait and I belonged to this category. Then after just 5 minutes, I was called for an interview with the guy who was coordinating the entire interview process for the day. He had been working with Microsoft for 15 years (he was some manager, I don't remember exactly :D).
One on one interview
I went in with my resume in hand. After the usual introduction part, he asked me how the group fly round was for me. He also went through my resume at the same time. I replied saying that it wasn't great for me. He asked what was the problem according to me. I said that I felt that the time wasn't enough and that I couldn't complete the last question (the meeting question described before). He pulled out my answer sheet and to my surprise said that I had done very well at the test. Then he turned to the last question (almost most of the other questions were marked correct) and asked me to explain how I would be solving it if I had time. I explained to him the same naive solution which I had in my mind earlier and expected that he would ask me to improve it. But he didn't ask any further questions and told me that it was my last interview. On hearing this I was of the impression that I was rejected and no further interviews would be conducted for me. But he continued to say that I was selected and asked me if I have any questions for him. I asked about what kind of work are interns given. He responded and the interview was over.
I came out happy and had the lunch they had arranged for the candidates :D. Later I came to find out that there were many rounds of interviews for most people and only a few had just one round.
Some Important points and takeaways
Think out loud. Explain your approach to the interviewer and let him know all that you are thinking of. Most of the time he/ she will guide/ hint you constructively to the solution. Also instead of jumping directly to write a solution, take your time, ask and clear any doubts, you have regarding the question. Also, state any assumptions you are making.
Practice writing code on pen and paper. Most of the interviewers expect executable code to be written down. Which can at times be difficult to write without tools like autocomplete and auto-indentation.
Follow good and standard coding practices. And try to write your code in a manner that is easier to read and comprehend.
Always ask relevant questions to the interviewer when prompted to do so at the end of the interview. Try to keep these questions different in each round.
Be honest and confident about the stuff mentioned in your resume.
Keep practicing DSA and solving problems on online platforms.
Go through the GFG interview archives for the company you are about to interview.
Some companies tend to ask brain teasers in interviews, I observed that there are only around 30-40 of them from which they mostly ask. So search online, make a list of such brain teasers, and be familiar with the solution. I have seen people getting rejected in the final phases of their interviews just because they couldn't solve a brain teaser.
And at last… All the best and keep trying :) !!!

In online test aptitude and three coding questions were asked. The coding round was easy. 
CGPA cut off is 6.00.
The base salary is 7 LPA there is no split up.
There were two interview rounds.
In the first round, few coding questions and puzzles were asked.
Questions that I remember are
1. Reverse a linked list in groups.
2.and few simple pattern printing 
The pseudo-code was enough.
The second round was technical + HR.
In the second round 
Few general HR questions 
Such as 
1. What are your hobbies.
2.what are your favorite subjects. What is the special care that you have taken on them?
3.what do you do in your free time.etc?
He didn't ask about my projects but asked if I had used my favorite subjects knowledge in my projects.
Asked about ACID properties in DBMS with examples.
Few SQL queries were asked mostly inner join and left join.
He wrote a few codes in C using pointers and asked me to produce the outputs.
Few basic recursive coding questions were asked.
Again puzzles were asked in this round. Mostly from geeksforgeeks.
They prefer C/C++ over java.
OOPS concepts were asked in detail with examples.

Location: Pune
Duration: 8 Weeks
CGPA Cutoff: 7
Stipend : 75000 per month 
1 Online round + 1 Technical + 1 Pro-fit + 1 HR
Online Round consists of MCQ’s and a Coding Question. (60 Minutes)
MCQ’s were based on Time Complexities, sorting algorithms, Output for the given pseudocode, OOPS etc., 
Coding Question:
It’s a DP based Question. You have to reach the end of the array from the starting position given that you can move 2 steps ahead or 1 step backward. Find the minimum cost to reach the end of the array if you start from index 0. 
I traversed from the end and updated the cost if it started from that position. Finally you have to return DP value at index 0 since it’s starting from the first element.
The question was similar to this one
Minimize cost to reach end of an array by two forward jumps or one backward jump in each move - GeeksforGeeks
After this round, 5 got shortlisted.
Round 1 (Technical) :   45 - 50 Minutes

“Tell me about yourself?” (Most commonly asked one but be fluent in answering the question since it’s the first & best opportunity to show your communication skills.)
Asked to code Binary Search and then to dry run and explain with corner cases. Then asked for the complexity (Best case, Average Case, Worst Case). Asked for applications of binary search ( I’m not sure what he expected but I Just said it can be used to search very efficiently in any ordered data).
Then I was asked to code Merge sort. First, I was asked to explain the algorithm with an example, then code and dry run. Then I was asked for the complexities. Then I was asked what’s the common point in both binary search and merge sort (Both work on divide and Conquer principle). Then I was asked what other divide and conquer sorting algorithm I was aware of(I said Quick sort). I was asked the complexities of that, then asked for a worst case complexity example.
“Reverse a singly linked list . Mention its space and time complexities”.
“Explain about your projects.” (Took around 5-10 minutes to explain them.)
“Why do you want to join the Banking side instead of going to the Technology side?” I then said that the Banking also has a lot of technology involved, since there’s a lot of risk analysis involved and a lot of online services has to be provided which also involves many security factors to be taken care of and monitored. ( He is pretty much satisfied with my answer).
“Do you have any Questions?”  ( I asked 2 questions. I don’t remember now since I asked based on the situation.) 
After this 3 got shortlisted
Round 2 ( Pro fit) : 20 Minutes
“How’s your previous round? Which part do you like the most?”
“Explain about your projects?”
“What are your areas of interest?”
“Explain Neural Networks.”
Later, had some chat regarding AI as I mentioned it in my resume.
“What are the most difficult situations you have faced and how have you come out of them?”
“Tell me a situation where you are a good team player.”
“What are your hobbies?”
“Do you have any Questions?” 
I asked “How’s transition from the coding side to a managerial role. Did you miss coding?”
And one more question I don’t remember. But he was very much impressed with those.
After this 2 got shortlisted
Round 3 ( HR ) : 15 Minutes
“Tell me about yourself?”
“Which DB values do you like the most and why?” ( Listen to the pre-placement talk where they would discuss those)
“What challenges have you faced in your life? How do you overcome those?”
“What are your weaknesses? How do you get rid of those?”
“Why should we hire you?”
Then they took some required details to fill in the candidate's personal information.
Both got selected. (Mostly they don’t filter in HR round)
Next, we had an internship for 8 weeks. First one week for training and the last one week for interviews, so a total of 6 weeks of time was there to complete the project.
Location : Pune / Bangalore
CTC : 19.6 L
Base : 15 L
Mentor & Buddy Review + 2 Technical + 1 Pro-fit + 1 HR   
Round 1 ( Technical Round 1 ): 1 Hour 
“Tell me about yourself?”
Asked about extra curricular activities. I told about playing chess in my free time. He then asked about my ratings. I said I just casually played it on my phone.
Given a King & Knight on one side. Is it possible to checkmate a lonely king on the opponent's side?
I mentioned C, C++, and Python in my resume. So I was asked to code in C.
“Find the Factorial of a given number.” ( I then asked about the constraints if the value fits the long long int range or should I use char array to store.) (He said within Integer range).
Find unique words and their frequency. Question wasn’t hard but I was asked to solve it with File Handling (Write a string into the file and then open it). (I don’t exactly remember syntax for file handling in C, but I was able to get those fast since I used it many times in Networks Lab. But I’m not sure if there’s a small issue with it due to which file writing isn’t done correctly. I then asked if I can just code without file handling. He said ok. Then explained the logic and coded, then he tested with some inputs. (It would be very easy in Python but difficulty is to code in C))
I was asked to code Inheritance in cpp. I was completely unaware of OOPS syntax. I said I never used OOPS, neither went through any of the related electives, I just know the concept of inheritance and explained to him inheritance, and about access modifiers, that private variables or methods can’t be inherited and only public or protected can be.
Explain the difference between abstraction and Encapsulation.
Explain Python Data Structures. (Explained in detail about Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, sets, their similarities and differences)
“Find the nth Fibonacci Number” (I again asked if constraints are within integer limit and he said yes). (The reason I asked is that I have solved Project Euler problems where integer overflow and char array are to be accounted for to output the result).
Which sort algorithms are you comfortable with?. I said anything Merge sort, Quick sort or Heap Sort. He then said Ok code bubble sort. Never expected this would be asked. Firstly confused bubble sort with selection sort. But I was quickly able to get back and coded it. Then he asked for the Best, Average, Worst Case complexities. I said O(n^2) for all. I never knew that the best case complexity would be O(n). But then told that we can initially check if array is sorted, so the best case is O(n). Bubble Sort - GeeksforGeeks. (You could find here how to optimise bubble sort to get O(n) best case complexity).
Where do you want to see yourself in the next 5 years? (Again I thought I could go through this before the Pro-fit round. So I couldn't answer that clearly.)
Then asked a very simple GFG puzzle. You are in a room which has only two exits. One side there’s a dragon and on the other side there's a magnifying glass under the sun. How would you exit?
“Do you have any questions?” As I am aware that I couldn’t answer some of the questions, I asked for any advice he could give for me based on my performance? (But unexpectedly he said you have a very good subject knowledge, just concentrate on communication skills to express yourself) 
Round 2 ( Pro-fit Round ): 25 - 30 Min
Tell me about yourself.
If one of your teammates has a conflicting opinion, how would you handle that situation?
What are the challenges you faced? How did you overcome those?
What are your hobbies (ExtraCurricular activities) ?
What are your strengths and weaknesses?
How did you overcome your weaknesses?
Tell me everything you knew about Deutsche Bank?
What hardships have you come across during your internship project?
Why should we hire you?
Do you have any Questions? ( I asked two questions).
There is no right or wrong for these questions, so just keep on talking. They will encourage your involvement rather than some short direct answer.
Round 3 ( Technical Round 2): 50 Min
Tell me about yourself?
Explain your Verilog Project? 
Explain your OS Project? How many members were there per team? ( I said it was individual and took around 15 minutes to clearly explain about what all I did in OS Lab and explained the difference between system calls, hardware interrupts, module calls, and the working of those. Then he asked to explain what all modules have been made. I just told about the different modules done and a line about each and told about forking. As it was taking more time he said that’s fine we can continue with other topics).
Explain your DBMS Project? (Explained the abstract and told about what makes it unique from others.).
What is normalization and why is it required?
What is 1 NF? Explain with an example. Then he gave some column names and asked to tell candidate keys, primary keys, and if it follows 1 NF.
What is 2 NF? Explain with an example. Here again he gave some column names and asked which normalization it was and why?
What is 3 NF? Explain with an example. Again he gave some column names and asked which normalization it followed. ( I don’t clearly remember about 3 NF but I kept on telling things I know about 3 NF and in between he helped with the things if I got stuck)
Then he gave a coding question on Matrix that was sorted row wise and column wise https://leetcode.com/problems/count-negative-numbers-in-a-sorted-matrix/ Here instead of negative numbers, he asked positive numbers count.
First I told him the naive approach that in two loops you will check each of the elements and then increment the counter. Time Complexity : O(n*m)
Then I said as it is sorted row wise we can use Binary search to get the first positive number index and all the elements right to it are also positive. So for each row it’s O(logm) and for n rows it’s O(n*logm).
Then He asked if it could be further improved. I said yes, something like if we traverse from the top left column if it’s positive then you can stop at that point and all right to it and down to it are positive then you can get rid of some of the rows and columns). But I was not that sure of its working.
Then he said you are almost correct, I can give you a clue. Start at top right instead of top left. Then I got the approach. So basically you’ll start at the top right and check if the number is positive then the entire row and column are positive hence the m x n matrix can be reduced to m-1 x n-1 . He then said yeah that’s correct, it's called staircase approach and asked me to code the same in Python. Time Complexity is O(Max(m,n)).
Explain Subnetting and why is it used?
Difference between Micro Kernel and Monolithic Kernel.
Do you have any questions? (Asked two Questions, about what’s the generally allotted project duration and who is the one we have to discuss with regarding project progress.)
Round 4 (HR) : 10-15 Min
Tell me about yourself.
How did the previous rounds go?
Explain your project?
What was working in a virtual environment like?
What are the challenges you faced during the internship? How do you overcome those?
Will you consider the job offer if given? 
Do you have any questions? (Asked two questions like, apart from Technical meets which cultural fest you like the most in DB and why? )
Tips:
Try to ask at least one question (Preferably 2) according to the situation because this generally shows that you are interested in joining their company. 
Always go through HR questions and have some solutions for those in mind. Because, it’s very difficult to answer some of them quickly.
Try to maintain notes especially for core topics like DSA, OS, DBMS, Computer Networks. We were actually told 2 days before the interview that there would be four rounds of interviewing where core topics will be asked and notes best helped me to cover all the topics.
Never expect a coding question that you may have solved previously. Be confident to answer any as well. Try from the Naive approach because it shows the interviewer your thought process and also gives you time to optimise it and sometimes the interviewer also helps you with hints if you get stuck in between. 
Go through Leetcode or GeeksforGeeks rather than codechef or codeforces. Because, they are more designed from an interview perspective.
Finally be thorough with the basics of all topics since they mostly emphasise only on your subject understanding. Also go through ER and relational diagrams of your DBMS project. (Because some are asked to draw those).
Be thorough with all the projects you mentioned on the resume. (As you can see in most of the rounds they asked regarding those).
I strongly believe that saying NO isn't good practise. It depends on the interviewer again, because some like to hear only perfect answers and don’t care if you say no for some topics. But I personally faced rejections because of saying No. At the same time don’t bluff them with wrong answers ( Discuss something similar to that).
During Internship:
Complete Project as per the Mentor requirements and if possible try to go beyond their expectations (For us, mentor was very happy with our work)  You would maximum have one meet per week with the mentor, so in every meeting show your progress to them and take their feedback if there’s anything to improve. Document all the things you are doing and send them a mail a day before the weekly meeting including each of the individual participation since the meet would be mostly for 20-30 minutes and everyone may not get a chance to share their progress. Also, it would be easier for you to refer back at last. Ultimately Mentor & Buddy feedback will have a good weightage to your PPO selection.
If you have difficulties do discuss with the mentor stating all the work you did. They will guide you accordingly. Because we initially didn't have a sufficient dataset for Analysis, we escalated the issue with a mentor and got permission to proceed with a subset of the problem, otherwise we mostly wouldn’t have completed the project.

ASSOCIATE SOFTWARE ENGINEER
AUTHOR : MUHAMMED FARSEEN
CTC: 14 LPA.
Base: Same.
Location: Bangalore. (They only have one office, that’s in Bangalore) 
In my experience, there are two kinds of companies. Those that value experience, and those that assume that BTech students probably won’t have much experience. The interview experiences of these two is vastly different.
Companies of the first kind ask relatively simple questions, oriented around concepts. They focus more on your resume and your hobby projects.
The latter kind focuses more on your CGPA and expects you to come up with an algorithm to parse regular expressions within 20 minutes. Presumably, their logic is that, if you have spent enough time on geeks for geeks trying to brute-force through the interview procedure, you are hardworking enough to succeed in the corporate world.
My company, Strand Life Sciences, falls in the former category. I didn’t sit for the interviews of banks because I didn’t like them. I was at some point really scared that I narrowed my chances by doing that. And now that I’m here one month into the job, I’m pretty glad that I ended up here.
Before I tell you about the interview experience, let me talk a bit about my company.
The work environment is pretty chill. It is as chill as Murali Sir’s lab courses. As long as you get the job done in a reasonable amount of time, you’re good. No further questions are asked. Don’t care about when you work, or how you work. I feel autonomous. Meetings, standups etc are rare. As a person who finds meetings dreadful, I’m pretty glad. They don’t care about the machines you use. They even let me erase everything on the laptop they sent me and install Arch Linux and Minecraft. Communications happen through Discord.
Now the interview experience. The first round was a written test. They gave a bunch of conceptual questions. They were pretty simple. No brain teasers. No 50 line algorithms.
Here’s the question paper:
Here’s a summary of what I wrote:
It resolves DNS, finds the IP and connects to port 443, does TLS handshake, loads the HTML page, and renders it. I expanded this a bit and wrote in a paragraph.
I also went a bit further. I ran “curl --verbose https://bbc.co.uk”, and I was able to tell it to redirect to https://www.bbc.co.uk using HTTP 301 and it uses the more recent HTTP/2.0. I also wrote that I used that command to figure out all those.
I didn’t know Lisp. I tried to come up with an answer using my favorite cheatsheets website https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/common-lisp/. But the answer was wrong. I still don’t know the answer because I never learned Lisp properly. And the interviewer (who is my manager now) said during the interview that only one person got this correct but they got all other answers wrong.
I had watched two videos related to the first and the second part of the question, and those stuck in my head. Although I had taken Topics In Cryptography that semester, we hadn’t reached that section yet at the time of the interview. But Jimmy Jose sir did give a really good explanation of it afterward. The networks theory class was full of ethernet/wifi noise/error rate/speed/cable length numericals. So it was not useful for answering the second part of the question.
1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_wX40fQwEA
To answer this question, I think what helped me was that I had tinkered with statically typed languages and SQL databases in my personal projects so that I had an intuition about modeling the given problem.
Database and SE classes were too much theory and no practicals. So they all entered my left ear and exited through my right ear. The things that were useful for answering this question ended up sticking in my head because I had used them in some of my hobby projects.
This was the answer that I gave:
In the interview, they did ask me about my choice of enums and asked me if there is any other way. I answered we could have also done this by subclassing the CancerVariant class but then we have 2x2 = 4 subclasses for each Effect x Type combination. Another method is to make BenignEffect and PathogenicEffect classes extending Effect class, and accept an Effect class in the constructor; ditto for Type enum. They said I should have done that, and made seqInserted/seqDeleted a member of TypeInsertion/TypeDeletion instead of having a single seqAltered field.
TnP had specified that we should write the answers in an A4 sheet and scan it and send them.
I have a thing against authority. So I wrote it in Notion and sent them the PDF. The interviewer was actually baffled that this was a bunch of coding questions and everyone wrote in a paper and scanned and sent it.
The first round of the interview was basically a discussion of the answers I wrote.
In the second round of the interview, my current manager asked a bit about the projects I had in my resume. He is an alumnus of NITC, studied here in around 2000.
Both rounds were really chill.
For those who find doing competitive coding questions enjoyable. Good for you. Keep doing them. You have a large pool of companies waiting for you. 
For those who, like me, find doing them dreadful, you also have a good pool of companies waiting for you. Keep tinkering. Do hobby projects. Do coding-related stuff for Ragam and Tathva so that word will spread and people will bring you projects. This is how I got the project from MED. Try to network with Ph.D. and MTech people and BTech seniors. Work with them, you may get referrals from them when they join a company. Try to do a bit of HackerRank so that you don’t completely forget about DSA. Also try to keep the CGPA above 8, so that you don’t miss out on any opportunities.
All the best wishes.

PRODUCT ENGINEER
AUTHOR : NIKHIL PAI
No CGPA cut-off
Location: Bangalore
CTC: 10 LPA
Round 1: Online Test
People from all branches sat for this round. The 1-hour test consisted of all general aptitude questions.
Tip to ace: Go through the sample papers from Indiabix, and if you don't know how to solve a the question then dive deep into that topic and solve those questions.
Round 2: Technical 1
Around 40 people got shortlisted for this round. It was mainly based on my resume and a few questions based on it, followed by a puzzle to solve(The cliche puzzle of permutation of handshakes that take place among a group).
Tip to ace: Scan your resume thoroughly and be ready for all sorts of questions that follow up. It would be great if you have done an internship and try to explain in such a way that the interviewer gets an idea of what you're trying to convey. NEVER EVER LIE IN YOUR RESUME. They would see through it easily, which might lead to rejection.
Round 3: Technical 2
Fifteen people were shortlisted for this round. It was 100% coding-based. He asked me to convert a linked list into a queue. I had to code by sharing my screen, and when he felt I got the logic, he moved on to the next question, which was a puzzle. He, later on, asked another coding question which I don't remember but was fairly simple.
Tip to ace: Geeksforgeeks would be good enough to practice coding. Most importantly, explain the code to them while you're coding. Also, even if you don't know the language that they are looking for, give them the surety that you will learn it.(And do learn it xD).
Round 4: HR
Nine people were shortlisted for this round. It was a general round that mostly included the mainstream HR questions.
Tip to ace: Do keep a few questions to ask them and try to make it more of a conversation and less of an interview.
General tips
● Focus more on array, list, linked list, string questions for the coding as it is most repeatedly asked during interviews. But have an idea to do all the basic operations for the other data structures as well.
● Don't be nervous. Take a chill-pill and don't look at it as an interview, it should feel more like a casual conversation.
● Practice more coding questions from GFG, leetcode, as most of the interview questions are asked from these sites. Don’t worry too much; you will definitely ace it!

CTC : 9.6 
Eligibility : M.Tech and B.Tech 
Visited on : Oct,2020 
Placement Experience 
Round 1: Computer Based Online Recruitment Test (2 hours) 
MCQ Questions were from Aptitude, Verbal, Logical and two coding questions 
Round 2: Technical and Managerial Round (30 minutes) 
He started with “Tell Me About Yourself” and then Project-related non-technical questions like what was team size, my role, how I managed the project and tools and technologies used. Then he asked what the difference between Method overloading, overriding and method hiding was, followed by the difference between Abstract class, Interface and class and their usage preferences.  Then he asked why I chose L&T Info-tech, and what made me different from the others. 
Round 3: HR (30 minutes)
He asked situation based questions, the question was “suppose you have a new idea and  implementation would improve project efficiency and correctness but your Team leader and team are not convinced with idea, in that case, how would you convince your team” 
He asked me to briefly explain about my academics from high school to M.tech with my results and passing year. Since, I have a three year gap between B.tech and M.tech, rest of the questions were based on justifying the year gap. 
Tips: Trust me if you are  wisely giving an honest answer, you can handle rapidly fired questions and deliver the necessary explanations.  If you have any year gap, mention it. One way or another they will get to know.

TECHNOLOGY SUMMER ANALYST
AUTHOR : MEENAKSHI MADHU
CGPA cut-off: 6.5
Location: CITI CSC Chennai (Remote)
Stipend: 40000 per month
Round 1: Online Test
The 2-hour test consisted of Aptitude, Reasoning, Technical, English language MCQs, followed by two coding questions.
The aptitude questions can be solved using basic math and logical thinking. Many previous years’ test questions are available on websites like Geeks For Geeks etc. Practicing and being familiar with some concepts make it easier to figure out solutions quickly.
Technical questions had topics such as C, Data structures (trees, linked lists, etc.), Algorithms, DBMS, OS, OOPS concepts, time complexities, stacks, queues. Previous years’ pattern of questions along with strong fundamental knowledge in these topics can be helpful. Websites like Geeks For Geeks, IndiaBix can be referred to for past interview/test experiences. Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell is also a good reference book.
English language: grammar and reading comprehension.
Coding test: Practice a lot on online platforms like Leetcode, Hackerrank, etc. The more you practice, the more familiar you will be with concepts.
Try to solve at least one of the coding questions completely and score maximum in the MCQ test.
Round 2: Technical Interview
The two interviewers were very friendly and helpful (one of them turned out to be my manager during my internship!). I was asked to introduce myself.
Most of the questions were from what I had on my resume, including my projects and the courses I had in college.
Many questions related to OOPS concepts were asked (e.g., inheritance, class concept).
The interviewer asked me some linked list-based questions for which I was supposed to type out the logic or algorithm. But since we faced some connectivity issues during my interview, it got shifted to a phone call. So instead, I explained my logic.
Be sure to explain your thought process while solving such questions for which you need to give the logic/algorithm. The interviewer might prompt you or give feedback on your approach, which can be helpful. 
Remember that your way of approaching a problem is also important.
Round 3: HR Interview
The interviewer was very friendly and introduced herself and asked me to introduce myself as well. 
Asked me about the activities and responsibilities I had in college since I had mentioned them in my resume.
“Why do you want to work at Citi?”, “What are your strengths and weaknesses?” were some of the questions I had in this round. 
They also ask you if you have any questions for them. Try to ask smart questions, either about the company or the work, preferably something the interviewer can answer with their personal experience at the company.
Few more tips:
Most of the questions for both interviews were based on the resume. So, avoid bluffing on your resume, and make sure you know at least the basics of any skill or project you mention.
Practice aptitude questions and score well for the MCQ test.
Go through previous years’ interview experiences for the company.
Avoid silences and pauses and instead explain your thought process while solving problems in an interview.
The interviewer does not expect you to know everything under the sun, but rather what you tell them you are comfortable with. E.g., when it comes to programming languages, even if you aren’t familiar with many, make sure you are thorough with the basics of the ones you know.
Be confident and honest during the interview and give your best!

AUTHOR : TUSHAR KUMAR PATNI
Minimum CGPA: 6.5
STIPEND: Rs 40,000 per month 
BRANCH: OPEN for ALL
ONLINE TEST:
Test occurs on AMCAT and lasts for 2 hours. It had four sections 
● Logical Reasoning (14 MCQ’s)
● Quantitative Aptitude and English (16 MCQ’s)
● Technical (25 MCQ’s) 
● 2 Coding questions (60 mins).
The first 2 sections can be solved easily with basic math and with some logical understanding. Technical MCQs consisted of topics like OOPS concepts, stability and time complexities of sorting algorithms, basic output questions, basics of stacks, queues, and trees. Most of the questions were MCQ and some fill in the blanks. In section 4, you will have coding questions which have to be solved in 1 hour. Those questions will be different for all and if you are lucky you may get an easier one. For me one was encrypting the given string in fashion which was specified in the question. Second question was a little bit tricky but easy if you get the logic. It was only 2 lines of if-else statement code. I was able to complete both the questions and pass all the test cases. Do well in the Online test. Your OT score matters a lot and increases your chance of getting selected. You will be given preference if you solve at least one of the codes completely and almost all questions in the first 2 sections.
Total 14 students were selected for the next Technical Interview. 
Round-1: Technical Interview
There were 2 panelists. They asked me how I was feeling (answered “excited and a little bit nervous”) and then introduced myself. After I finished my intro, they asked for a start-up idea which should be technical and have potential to bring change in the society. Then, they asked few questions related to Data Structure like name all data structures you know and give its real-life as well as normal examples where we can use those data structures and then OOPs concepts, C Vs C++, explain all the four pillars of OOPs, what are Objects and Classes? What are Virtual functions? and a few more which I don’t remember. 
After that, they asked me to explain one of my projects which I mentioned in my resume. Then, they asked a few questions related to DBMS and Computer networking which I was not able to answer because I hadn't read that at that time. In the end, they asked if I had any questions to ask them. I asked for their experience with CITI and the tasks we will be assigned during the internship. Always ask questions in the interviews as it will keep much more interaction with the interviewer during the interview.
Total 8 students were selected for the next HR Round.
Round-2: HR Round
The first question was to introduce myself, then my strengths and weaknesses, my hobbies, then will I be able to adjust with their work culture? Why CITI? As I was from North India, she asked me if I was able to adjust in Calicut or not and would I be able to adjust with them in Chennai? Then they asked if I had any questions to ask. 
Result was announced after 3-4 hours of the HR round. Total 6 students were selected and I was one of them.
P.S: Be Confident throughout the process. Be honest when you speak about your skills. Be strong with your fundamentals. ALL THE BEST.

TECHNOLOGY SUMMER INTERN
AUTHOR : NEELIMA SAJEEV
<neelima_b180632cs@nitc.ac.in>
Location - Chennai
Number of rounds - 3 ( Online Test + 1 technical / non technical interview + HR Interview )
Online Test - 
It was conducted on the AMCAT platform and consisted of technical MCQs, quantitative, aptitude, logical reasoning, English MCQs and 2 Coding Questions . Fairly easy MCQs and coding questions came under array/string manipulation and Backtracking. My advice is to look up any and all coding questions given under citibank internship reviews and interview diaries online and make sure you are able to solve all of them. This alone goes a long way.
Round 2 - Technical / Non technical interview -
There were two interviewers, one of which asked more non-technical questions.
The technical questions were related to 
OOPS concepts - What are the four principles of OOPS. Explain in detail. What are the different access specifiers? A situation requiring data abstraction is given and you have to solve it using access specifiers to give the desired outcome.
Data structures and string functions - Given certain string related situations, how would you solve it. It is advised to know all the existing string functions and use them as solutions instead of loop solutions. Naturally we need to try and give the most optimum solution.
Non technical Questions - 
If you had to learn Java in a week, could you do it?
A situation was given where an error occurred on the company's side. If you are in charge, how would you handle it and what would your priorities be?
Finally, they will ask you if I had any questions. It is not necessary to have one and definitely not advised to force a question, however having one prepared would have its benefits and will go a long way as it will show your interest levels.
Round 3 - HR Interview -
Main questions -
Introduce yourself.
What are your hobbies?
Are you an extrovert or an introvert?
What do you think is the biggest challenge about being a team player?
Why CitiBank?
And finally, do you have any questions for me? ( Again re-emphasizing , you do not have to force a question if you do not have any in mind)
Overall they were rather friendly interviewers. Just be sure to radiate confidence, keep a calm smile on your face and admit openly if you are not able to answer a question.

Pre-assessment test(online): Mcqs(aptitude,cs based questions) and 2 coding questions were given.The coding questions are pretty simple. I don't remember the questions. But both were based on arrays.
12 students are selected after this.
Interview(Technical+hr): The interview happened on Webex and was a one-to-one interview. My interviewer was friendly throughout the interview. Time taken was around 45 min. Some of the questions are:
•Tell me about yourself
•He asked how did I implement the code in the coding exam. (the approach)
•He asked me quite a few questions on the projects I had mentioned in my resume.
•There were a few questions on data structures and os.
•After that he asked some HR questions like you are currently working on some project which is what you see as your learning type and your manager asked to switch to another project. So what would you do? Another one was- after you submitted the code to the company you found bugs in the code. How would you handle that situation?
•He also asked where I was creative?
•What do you know about Ford?
•Why Ford?
3 students are selected after this

Total Rounds: 2 
Round 1: Coding Test
The test involved 2 questions on basic data structures and algorithms.
Round 2: Technical Interview
The interview started with the basic introductory question "Tell me about yourself". It was followed by questions based on the resume and the projects explained on the resume. That was followed by asking what would you do differently if you had to do the same projects again. Then, the next question was on which programming language was selected for the coding test and why that language was used. My answer to that question was that I had used Python, so the next few questions were about the different features of Python (like about magic methods in Python). Then questions on the basics of OOPs followed. Finally, the interviewer asked whether I had any questions to ask him.
Note: My interview as well as the internship happened virtually due to the covid-19 pandemic. The number of rounds or patterns could be different if the process was done on campus.

ENGINEER L3
AUTHOR : SHUBAM MITTAL
Package - 17lpa
Base - 14lpa
Location - Hyderabad
1) First Round 
In first-round, there was one interviewer and it almost went for 1 hour. It started with how college and other online classes going on from home and then my introduction. After that, he asked about my project very conceptually and asked me to brief it properly.
Please make sure that whatever you did, you should be very clear about it.
He asked questions from Operating Systems like the difference between mutex and semaphore, scheduling algorithms and what are the modules that I had implemented in the project.
After that, he asked one array question which I solved with recursion. So, in that, I was given an array of sequence from 1 to n and I had to find every permutation like (1,2), (1,3), (1,4) …… and similarly for other indexes also.
 
First I told him brute force approach with recursion and he was okay with it, then he modifies the question for permutation of three numbers (1,2,3) , (2,3,4)..... like that and asked to write code in whiteboard and dry run it also, I had done that in the same way.
 
After that he asked question of a matrix in which I was given a matrix of dimension n x m and we have to rotate in such a way that starting two elements of the first row are at the position of the last two indexes of the same row and all other elements of the first row are in the last column, this should be done like a circle from outside to inside for every two rows from top and bottom and columns from first and last. I told him about the approach of the while loop and four loops inside it and he was satisfied with it. 
First-round finished with this question and I was in hope that I get a call for the second round.
2) Second Round
I got the call for the second round immediately. In this round, there was a single interviewer and he was mainly focussed
on projects.
 
So he asked me to explain the main project that I have done till now. I explained to him about the Operating systems project (OS lab) that I had done in the 5th semester. He asked questions from what I was explaining to know more about it and this went on for almost 30 minutes.
 
After that, he asked one question from stack and array. Assume that you have two stacks and you want to implement it from one single array how will you implement it. The way he explained the question to me, I didn’t get what he trying to say for most of the time.  So I told him some approaches but that was not correct actually and then finally he explained the solution.
 
Lastly, there was a question he asked about logical thinking or common sense, assume you have x flowers in a well in day1 and on each
day flowers are doubling from what you have on the previous day. So at some day well is full. He wants to know how many flowers are there in a well on just the previous day when it was full.
 
The answer to this problem is that we have to just divide the number of flowers that we have on that day when the well was full by 2.
 
In this way, 2nd round was completed.
 
3) HR round     
This was the final round of the process and the interviewer was the senior HR manager at Oppo. Firstly, he asked me about how things are at home and what all other activities and interests I pursue other than academics.
 
I didn’t get much time to research for the company so he was about this fact. He assumed that as negligence and lack of interest from my side. I explained myself saying that I had been caught up with the preparation for technical interviews and midterm exams
Then he asked some puzzle-type questions. There is weigh balance and N balls of the same weight except one. I have to find the ball in the minimum number of balances
 
At last, he asked if I had any problem with relocation and the package.
 
I was selected for the Engineer L3 role.
I just want to say that don’t fake anything in front of them as they know everything.
If you don’t know or do not have any idea about any question simply say ‘I don’t know’.

Round 1 - Coding and Aptitude Test
This round basically consists of 4 sections: First is Programming based, Second is English based to check our comprehensive knowledge and communication skills, Third is based on Mathematics and Logical reasoning, and Fourth contains 2 Coding problems. Both the problems were neither easy nor hard. They were based on Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack, Queue and pointers. The Coding problems are different for all students.
Round 2 - Technical Interview
Approximately 20 students were shortlisted for the Technical interview round. There were 2 different modes for conducting the interview, students could either opt for a telephonic interview or do the same via Google meet. I had done my interview through Google meet. The duration of the interview was 15-20 mins and it could go longer based on the student’s performance.
The interviewer started with “Tell me about yourself” and right after that he moved to my resume. He asked me about my skills, interests and asked about which skills I was good at. As I was very confident in DBMS, I replied that. Then he asked me 4-5 questions from DBMS and some SQL queries. Although he tried to trick me, I stayed calm and replied with a cool mind. He was pretty impressed with my answers. He then moved on to another section, asked me some basic programming questions and the programming languages I know. He asked me about which one I prefer, and at last some 1-2 general questions. He wished me good luck and the interview was done.
Round 3  - HR Interview
Only 2 students were shortlisted for the HR Interview round including me. Procedure is the same as the previous Technical round. The Duration of the interview was 10-15 mins.
The Interviewer started with “Tell me about yourself”. He had a look at my Resume as no projects were mentioned in it. He interviewed other students from other colleges and they had done the projects and interesting thing was they weren’t from the CSE branch. He asked me by comparing to them why wipro would prefer you as you hadn't done any projects. I took a deep breath and answered. And he was amazed after listening to me. He told me to differentiate between the programming languages. And finally some general questions about location and all. The Interview was done.

Round 1 - Coding and Aptitude Test
4 Rounds were conducted to test basic Aptitude, Communication, Programming, Logical and Reasoning Skills. The Programming round contained questions regarding Array and String Manipulation. Most students should be able to solve it fairly easily.
Round 2 - Technical Interview
This Round was conducted through Google Meet and took around 10-15 mins. I was asked to introduce myself, and to summarise what I had on my resume. He asked me to choose a programming language and asked a few questions on that. He also tested my knowledge of OOPS concepts and basic OS fundamentals. He asked many questions about a project I had listed on my resume. So you have to be thorough with everything on your resume. He then asked if I can work in a team and a few general questions before concluding the interview.
Round 3  - HR Interview
The HR meeting was also conducted through google meet and it took around 10 mins.
She asked me to introduce myself, and then to summarise my resume. She then asked me a few questions about my projects. She asked about my passion and what I had done in the past year, which would serve as value addition. She asked a few HR questions about my communication skills and the ability to participate actively in a team. She asked if I had any questions before concluding the interview.

Eligibility : BTech all branches , MTech all branches , MCA 
Visited on : 15-10-2020 
Placement Experience
My name is Naram Ganesh Chandra Sekhar. I was selected for the role of graduate engineer trainee in Nokia networks.  Package: 8 lpa. The package and the role will change after one year training at Nokia. 
The entire interview process contains:- 
First round: Aptitude + reasoning + verbal + two coding questions. This round was conducted in AMCAT. Coding questions were easy, but we needed to do it within a specified time i.e 1 hour. I solved one full coding question and for the other question I was able to pass only a few test cases. I thought I wouldn't clear this round, but I cleared it. They took around 74 people for the next round out of  around 700 students. 
Second round: This was also a coding round but it was more difficult than the previous round. The duration for this round was 3hrs. It was conducted in hacker earth. There were a total of 3 questions. Marks distribution for two questions was 50 and other questions were 20. Total  120 marks. I got 60 out of 120 marks. You can clear this round if you solve questions from the hackerrank website. After this round, around 12 people continued to the technical round.
Technical round: 
It was conducted in Microsoft teams. the total time was 1 hr. In my panel, there were 3 people two for technical and one for managerial.
1) They asked me "In which language are you comfortable?". I said C and CPP. They started asking 
questions from C. Topics are recursion, structure, union, structure padding etc. 
2) They asked some SQL queries.
3) Oops concepts.
4) They gave a real world problem, and asked how we could solve it. I don't remember the question, but it was based on process synchronization.
5) TCP three way handshake. Explain it. While thinking about these questions, the other panel member was asking managerial questions.
6) Hashing techniques.
7) They asked questions on my project.
8) They asked about 5G technology.
9) Who is the present CEO of Nokia?
10) Database normalization techniques.
11) Deadlock.
12) Priority inversion in OS.
13) Difference between TCP and UDP? Why do we use TCP instead of UDP in some cases?
For me they had conducted only one technical round, but for some students they took two or three 
technical rounds.
HR round: 
This round was for about 15 minutes.
1) Introduce yourself? 
2) He asked me about my BTech project. 
3) He asked me about 5G. 
Finally I was selected. 
Out of 12, 7 are selected. 
Tips:
1) Study core subjects. 
2) Don’t neglect aptitude and reasoning. Competition is very high. If you clear the first round, then you will most probably get the job.
3) Solve hackerrank questions and refer to geeksforgeeks. Must do coding questions.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENGINEER - INTERN
AUTHOR : NIDHIN MOHAN
We first had our usual coding test, consisting of questions similar to medium-level Hackerrank questions. For the interviews, there were three rounds.
The first round of interview was mainly about my problem solving skills and regarding different concepts in computer science. I was asked about some of my interests in the field. I had mentioned making simple console games for practice and they asked me a question regarding that. It was about what all was needed to make a simple minesweeper game that I had to explain using object oriented programming, such as what all steps were to be followed to initialise the game board and the different objects. They didn’t focus on every single detail, but more on a general approach, such as which data structures to use, how the various attributes can be stored, etc. This applies for almost all the problem-solving questions.
During the second round of interview, they further asked if I knew about other topics in computer science, such as Database Management Systems. I said I didn’t know much about the topics so they didn’t go deep into that. Then they asked about some other interests, to which I answered I am interested in mathematics and then they asked which areas of mathematics I had preferred. They also asked about a workshop I had conducted on HTML/CSS. 
My third round of interview was more general questions. Some of the questions that were asked were why I had chosen Wells Fargo, elaboration on some of the projects I had done, where I see myself in the future, etc. 
At the end of each round, they also gave us opportunities to ask them any questions we had regarding the internship.

● Stipend - Rs 80,000 per month and a one time settlement allowance of Rs 10,000 
● CGPA cutoff - 6.5 
● Location - Bangalore/ Hyderabad (Virtual) 
The selection process started off with a PPT followed by an online test. The test had 3 sections. 
1. English Comprehension. 
2. Business Analytics and financial questions - I was not so sure of the answers as I did not have much knowledge about the financial field. 
3. Coding - There were 2 questions of intermediate to hard difficulty levels. 
More than 20 students were shortlisted and the interviews were conducted the next day.There were 3 rounds of interviews - two technical rounds and one HR round. 
For the first technical round, I was asked questions about data structures, especially trees and arrays. The interviewer was considerate enough to ask about the subjects I had in previous semesters and hence did not ask much from DBMS and OS. I was also asked to solve a coding question based on a given scenario. There were logical questions from Mathematics as well. 
For the second technical round, questions were mainly about data structures and no coding questions were asked. 
I had my HR round scheduled the next day. Typical HR questions which you find in sites like Indiabix were asked. It’s good to spend some time to know yourself and to have the answers ready rather than trying to make up one at the moment. 
7 people were finally selected for the internship. 
Some Tips 
● Technical knowledge is not all that matters! Your attitude matters a lot. I was not able to answer all the questions I was asked during the interview. But somehow I could speak confidently. I strongly believe that as one of the reasons why they chose me. Even if you are shivering deep inside, don’t show it on your face :)
● Rather than wasting time, be ready to say “I don’t know Sir/Mam” if you are not sure of the answer and they may give you hints. 
● Avoid long silences even while you are thinking. 
● For coding questions asked, make sure you understand the question and ask all doubts and corner cases and they will be more than happy to answer. You can also ask a sample case if you want. 
● In all the rounds, I was asked about the projects I had mentioned in my resume. Be sure to answer any questions about the projects like the challenges you have faced and how you solved those. 
● Spend some time to know about the company and be ready with some questions for the interviewers. Good questions are sure to show our interest in the firm. Be confident, do your best and success will follow. All the best!

AUTHOR : ANISH SHARMA
The online test was hosted on AMCAT and was a fairly straightforward test with 3 sections 
English - This had simple English grammar and comprehension based questions. Nothing too complex, just plain regular English. 
Business and Finance - There were a few questions regarding business decisions and risk management using a few case studies, some of which included graphs and tables. It wasn't much difficult as it was just based on very simple arithmetic. 
Coding Test - There were 2 coding questions related to Data Structures. Both problems were comparable to medium difficulty questions on hackerrank. 
Overall, the test wasn't hard if you had been preparing for such tests. As mentioned, the coding problems were just as difficult as medium level problems on hackerrank. 
Technical Round 1 
The first techinical round was entirely comprising of technical questions. After I had given my name and introduction, the interviewer asked me a coding problem and asked me to solve it live by sharing my screen. 
I asked if I can use my preferred language (python), and he agreed to it. So, I started coding the problem. 
The first coding problem was related to find maximum sum of any 2 consecutive elements in an array where the array is in random order (i.e. not sorted). I tried solving the problem and the interview tried to guide me a little towards the solution. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find a solution in the time complexity that he wanted, so we had to skip over the problem. 
Then he gave me another problem to find sum of elements in an array with the optimal time. Since, the array was unordered, it was not possible to optimize it other than just summing all elements in a sequence. So, since I remembered how to use multi-threading in python, I divided the array into equal parts and summed them up using multiple threads (taking advantage of parallelization basically). 
After that were conceptual questions related to Data Structure and some questions about collections and ArrayLists in Java (my preferred language I had told him). 
Technical Round 2 
This round was primarily based on my resume and the projects I had mentioned. He asked me to give an introduction about myself and then asked me about my experience with projects etc. 
I had mentioned a previous internship of mine. I explained what I did during that. But he didn't have many questions regarding that. 
Then the other project I had mentioned was an E2EE chat application written in Java. He was primarily interested in that project, and most of that interview was spent on discussing the project. He asked me how it worked and how I went about designing it. He also asked a few questions regarding the potential problems my design could have, which I was able to address for the most part. 
Overall, it was a very friendly discussion and went very smoothly. HR Round 
This was the typical HR round with very generic questions. You can look up any HR interview preparation guide online, and most questions were same as those guides. 
Conclusion 
The interviews went well. I think my project and the multi-threaded summing of array solution were the primary deciding factors for me.

Siemens Healthneers visited our campus in September 2020. There was a pre-placement talk conducted by them, followed by the online assessment. 
Round 1 (Online Assessment): 
The assessment was conducted on Hackerearth. It had 20 MCQs based on Aptitude, Operating Systems, DBMS, Networks, JAVA, OOPS and 2 coding questions. 
Coding Question 1 : 
I do not recall totally, but it was a very very easy problem based on arrays. I felt everyone who had basic problem solving skills would have easily solved it. 
Coding Question 2: 
In order to solve this problem, one needed to have an idea of Modular Exponentiation. It was also an easy problem if one knew this concept and had good observational skills. 
Luckily I managed to solve both coding problems and did a decent amount of MCQs correctly. Out of around 150 students, only 14 were shortlisted for interviews. 
Tips: 
1) Be familiar with various interfaces like hackerrank, hackerearth and have knowledge of some optimizations like Modular Exponentiation. Key to this is Competitive Programming. 
2) Luck plays a very important factor, so be patient. 
Technical Round 1, (10:15 AM - 11:30AM): 
It was conducted on Microsoft teams. I received the invite link a day before the interview. There were two interviewers, each of them had my resume with them. It started with a general introduction. I had done a project on Operating Systems as part of the Operating systems lab where I built a toy operating system from scratch. He asked me to explain about the project. I took around 8-10 minutes and explained to him thoroughly. They asked me a few counter questions about it like “How was the exec system call done”, “how were semaphores handled”. Whatever you say, counter questions will be from that part only, so think before saying and practice beforehand what to speak. 
Next they switched to the Internship Project which I did. They asked me to give an overview about the project and explain about my role in the project. I took some time and explained to
him thoroughly about the project and my role. Since the project was on Android Development, they asked a few questions on Android Development like 
“What is Activity”, “What is intent”, “what is responsive design”, “Explain views”, “what oops concept have you implemented in your project”, “what is agile methodology” Thankfully, I had studied them for previous interviews so I managed to answer them. 
Next they switched to OOPS and asked a few questions. 
“Differentiate between abstraction and encapsulation”, “explain runtime polymorphism”, “What is Abstract class”, “what is pure virtual function”, “what is virtual function” etc. All these very pretty basic questions and one can easily answer them if studied thoroughly. 
Next on the list was DSA. 4-5 questions based on DSA were asked out of which 2 were medium level and rest were very easy for me. 
Q1) Find an element which is present only once in the array, while other elements are present twice. (Easy) 
Q2) Given elements from 1 to N, find missing elements. (Easy) 
Q3) Given a number, find its Roman Numeral (Medium) 
Q4) Given a URL, give an algorithm to find a tiny url (Medium) 
Q5) Merge Sort Code (Medium) 
They asked 2-3 more, but I can’t recall it while writing about this experience. 
Tip : If you feel the question asked is easy, write a full working code considering all the corner cases and if you feel the question asked is tough, try to interact as much with the interviewer and at least put the logic into his head. If he feels that logic is correct, there are chances that he might not ask you to write code. 
Next they asked 2-3 questions on Operating Systems like “What is process”, “what is thread”, “differentiate between process and thread”, “what is deadlock, conditions for deadlock”. All of these are very easy if one knows the basics correctly. 
Lastly, a question about SQL query was asked (“N highest age of employee”) and a question on joins and type of joins. They asked if I had any questions to ask. I asked a few of them and with this, the round was over. 
I felt I answered almost all of the questions, so I was expecting a call for the second round. Out of 14, 4 were selected for the second round and I was one of them.
Managerial Round (6:45 PM to 7:45PM): 
This round was also conducted on Microsoft Teams. This time there was only one interviewer, but he was a senior employee of Siemens. He asked me to introduce myself, meanwhile he went through my resume. He asked me a bit of a different question. He asked what I remember from the Pre-placement Talk. Luckily I had gone through their website, so I just answered what all I remembered from their website. 
Next, he asked about the operating systems project which I had done. I explained the project to him thoroughly and he then asked a few cross questions. First, he asked if I had done threading in it. Since I had not done threading in it, I said no. He then said, “Let's discuss how you would implement threading here”. I was a bit afraid to be honest. But then we had a discussion for 10-15 minutes about how we can implement threading in a hypothetical Operating system. I felt he was a bit satisfied with my approach. Next, he asked how I handled semaphores in my project. I explained it in the best way possible. He again came back to threads. He asked how I would handle semaphores for threads. I somehow answered it with the knowledge I had about threads. 
Next topic of discussion was DSA. He asked my favourite Data structure and I said tree. So 1-2 questions based on trees were asked. I didn’t have to code them, just telling the algo would be sufficient. Both were easy. 
One was to find the maximum element from the tree (Easy). 
Now he switched the context and asked 3-4 situational problems and asked about what would be my approach to them. All of them were new and had to be answered based on one’s instinct. I felt I gave satisfactory answers to all of them. With this the question asking session was informally over. After this, we talked about cricket, about my approach to writing clean code, and 1-2 managerial questions. 
At the end, he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked 1-2 questions and he happily answered all of them and with this the round was over. Next round was the HR round which was scheduled the next day. Since I didn’t receive the mail for the HR round, it was a difficult night to sleep. I would wake up randomly and check if I received the mail for the next round. (sed lyf)
HR Round, Next Day (11:45 AM - 12:30 PM): 
Next morning, I checked the mail and I didnt get any invite. So, I assumed that they didn’t select me and so I carried on with my routine life and started preparing for the next company. It was at 10 am that my PR messaged me that I have been selected for the next round(Out of 4, 3 were selected for HR) . That was a big relief. I again went through their website and took important points from them and meanwhile prepared for basic HR questions. 
It all went smoothly and after a series of basic HR questions and a brief overview of my background the round was over. 
Results came at 5:10 PM. Yes, I remember the time because I was almost in tears.
Verdict : 2 of us were given FTE roles. That was quite a moment. 
Tips: 
1) Placements are 60 percent knowledge and 40 percent luck. And that 40 percent will haunt you, mark my words. So, make sure you are fully prepared with the 60 percent knowledge factor that plays part. 
2) Try to practice coding problems from leetcode, geeksforgeeks, interviewbit. Also try to do virtual contests on leetcode to get experienced with the time constraints of the exam.
3) OS, Networks, DBMS, OOPS are the main topics, study them rigorously. 
4) I revised these subjects a lot and there came a stage where they were stuck in my head which meant I didn't need to make answers. 
A sincere thanks to geeksforgeeks in my journey for siemens. It was impossible without you.

Pre-Assessment Test(Online): This round was a mix of Aptitude and Technical questions - The questions focused on output prediction, OOPS, DBMS and OS . I would suggest focusing more on technical questions, specifically output type questions. The languages used for output type questions were not fixed but most of them were from C++ or Java so having a basic understanding of the syntax would be sufficient. 
(Technical + HR) Round: This was a technical + HR round. I was a bit nervous so he told me to calm down and then we started. 
He asked to introduce myself - While introducing yourself cover all aspects, not only your academic and technical capabilities but also your soft skills. It would be good to state some managerial activities you may have participated in. 
He saw C++ mentioned in my resume so he asked me about OOPS concepts. Some of the topics he touched upon were:  four pillars of oops, dynamic binding, compile time, run time. Be confident while you answer. 
I also had cloud computing mentioned in my resume. He asked me some questions regarding cloud computing and what the cloud is, why we need it and some technical questions related to cloud computing. I had done a project using cloud computing so he asked me some questions related to that. Be sure that you are confident about what you have mentioned in your resume. 
After that he started asking me some HR questions. Most of them were generic
Why siemens? 
Where do you see yourself in 5 years as well as 10 years. I told him that in five years I see myself as a project lead in Siemens leading a team. For 10 years I mentioned that I would like to build my own startup to work on my ideas. 
Are you planning to do Mtech/Ms. I said that I wasn’t considering it at the moment. Maybe after 2-3 years of exploring corporate life I may consider an Mtech/Ms.
I asked him what projects we were going to work on if we were selected as interns. Be interactive.
Finally he said that he was happy to talk to me and the interview ended. 14 people were selected (7 from Computer Science).

Mode of Internship: Online
Stipend: Rs. 25,000 a month (with compensation)
Online Test - 
The online test had a few phases, the first being a rapid fire questionnaire. It had short questions that dealt with topics such as logical and verbal reasoning, which usually we could answer at a normal pace in contrast to having around 10-15 seconds for each question. After that, it was the usual MCQ questions such as guessing code outputs, quantitative aptitude and verbal reasoning, of which some had negative grading while others didn’t. (Do pay attention to that)
Interview Round -
Initially, two interview sessions were scheduled- a technical round and an HR round, although we only had the former. The interviewer was warm and amiable. He had gone through my resume and Github repos and took an interest in the projects I’ve done, so maintaining a well organized and diverse Github (or Gitlab? Azure? Your choice!) page for yourself with a bunch of fun projects you’ve done down the lane could fetch you some brownie points. The question he had asked me to code, although I do not recall the exact question itself, was about simple array manipulation. He had also asked customary questions about why Siemens, why should they hire you, your weaknesses, etc.
Of the 42 shortlisted candidates, 14 of us were hired.

AUTHOR : JERIN JOSE
1st Round (Online Test)
In this round, I was presented with two coding questions and a few MCQs on the platform, Hackerrank. One of the coding questions was easy. However, the tricky part was that the only language available was Java. It was a fundamental array-list question. I fail to recollect the second question. I was only able to solve it partially. The MCQs were related to DBMS, C/C++, OOPS, and DSA. I was to solve a minimum of a single coding question in this round. Knowing Java would have been a great advantage. 
2nd Round (Technical Interview 1) 
I found this round to be the toughest one. The interviewer asked me about the coding languages I was familiar with. As I was confident about Python, he asked me about the shortcomings of the same, the differences between C and Python, and the differences between a language run under a compiler (C) and an interpreter (Python). He then went through the advantages of using Java. When I said that my experience at the OOPS Lab had contributed to my familiarity with Java, he seemed keen and asked that I elaborate. He appreciated the fact that I put forth an attempt to learn Java. Later on, he moved on to some basic questions related to Java, followed by some suggestions to improve my coding. He then asked me to sort an array using a single loop alone. I specified that it was improbable to sort an array in O(n) complexity. He offered a few clues en route to help me. His efforts were in vain as I was not reaching anywhere. He chose to stop and told me that he was not looking for the correct answer but was looking for an idea about my approach to the problem.
 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-sort-an-array-in-a-single-loop/.
3rd Round (Technical Interview 2)
I found this round to be simpler than the previous one. It began with my introduction. The interviewer asked me a couple of simple coding questions. The very first question was to check if there was a loop in a linked list.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/. 
The second one was to check if a Binary Tree was a BST https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/ . 
The interviewer then moved to ask questions including How do you find the second largest salary in a table? What are ACID properties? What will happen when you type a URL and click enter? What is multithreading? What is the latest version of Java?, and other questions related to OOPS.   
4th Round (Managerial Interview)
The interviewer asked me about the project I handled during my internship. Where do I see myself in 5 years and what would I do if there were to be a conflict in my team were two of the queries asked. This round was brief.
5th Round (HR Interview) 
This round started with my introduction. The questions asked included Why NITC? Why CS? What is the best thing that you like about NITC? Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years? What are your strengths and weaknesses? Who is the CTO of SAP? What does SAP stand for? What kind of projects do you want to work on? What does SAP do? Who are the competitors of SAP? Which all locations are offered?
A final meeting was held to announce the results following this round. Everyone who gave the HR round was selected. The entire process started at 8 a.m. and ended at 10:30 p.m.
 
Important points:
Knowing Java is advantageous. 
Brush up on essential topics such as the OOPS concepts, Computer Networks, OS, etc.
Make sure to prepare a 'Tell me about yourself' beforehand as it boosts one's confidence. 
Listen to what the interviewer says about themself. You can ask questions pertaining to the same at the right opportunity. Prepare some good questions to ask the interviewer. It is recommended that you have 2-3 questions in mind.
Do let the interviewer know when you are unaware of the answer. 
Be confident.
Go through the various interview experiences from different sources. It gives an added edge as the questions are bound to be repeated.

1 Online Test + 2 Technical Rounds + 1 HR Round
Online Test -
There were two questions which were mainly based on data structures such as linked list and arrays. They were relatively easy and practice from sites such as GeeksforGeeks would suffice to qualify. Around 20 students were shortlisted from this round.
Round 1 - Technical Round
I was asked to introduce myself. Then, we went on to discuss the courses I had done in college and also the online courses I had mentioned in my resume.
Questions asked in this round:
Write the pseudo-code for checking if a word is a palindrome. I had to do a dry run of the code with an example as well.
Write the pseudo-code for bubble sort and had to do a dry run with an example.
Different sorting algorithms - their advantages and disadvantages, which is the best sorting algorithm. I answered in terms of time complexities and how the algorithms worked.
Round 2 - Technical Round
Questions asked:
Object-Oriented programming 
The interviewer wrote down some code and asked about the different OOPs concepts based on it.
Questions based on classes, inheritance and access specifiers were asked such as which all functions and variables can be accessed from child classes, etc.
I was then asked two questions for which I had to write the pseudo-code. 
The first was based on linked list
The next one was a bit more tricker. I gave the pseudo-code, but the interviewer wanted me to do a bit of error handling as well and asked me to come up with scenarios where my code could go wrong and how to take care of those cases as well.
I had mentioned Python in my resume. So, I was asked some questions regarding that. Mainly:
About the difference between tuples and lists.
How arrays and lists differ in python.
The lambda function (I provided the syntax, functionality and its use).
He then asked about what I understood by ‘cloud’. I explained what I knew about it, the different services offered such as IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. I was asked for examples for each and what their features were as well.
Round 3 - HR Round
This round was just a simple chat with the HR. She asked about how the interview process was so far and how it differed from the others that I had attended so far. Why I chose to apply for SAP and so on.
Suggestions:
Be thorough with your resume because the interviewers pick up questions from what you present in it.
When solving any coding question, keep explaining your thought process. This allows the interviewer to guide you to reach the right answer.
When asked whether you know a particular subject, do not hesitate to let them know if you are not well versed with the topic.
Revise the different data structures and algorithms.

Coding Test 
There were 2 problems. Make sure to pass all the testcases with an optimal solution. I used python to code both the problems 
20 were selected in this round
Round 1 : Technical 
It started with an introduction about myself and I was further asked about the projects I worked on. Explain everything about the project and your role in it and what you used. Then, he asked me to solve a couple of problems. Try to convey your thought process while you are working on the problem and if you think there are multiple ways to approach the problem, let them know. He gave around 3 problems for me to solve. I used python to solve the problem. He also asked for the solution for the problem using C. After that, we went to talk about the OOP concepts he asked about method overloading and method overriding.
7 were selected in this round
Round 2 : HR Round 
After an introduction about myself, I was asked why I want to join SAP? Who are the direct customers of the SAP? I was also asked about the fields I was interested in to which I responded Cloud Computing and Security. I was asked how all the interviews were so far and whether I asked any doubts with seniors who were currently interning at SAP.
7 of us were selected in the end

I had a pretty unconventional experience with the interview. The Coding rounds went fine. I don't remember what the questions were but then, if you do questions regularly, it won't be that much of an issue. Quite a few people cleared the coding round actually.
Now to the unconventional part. I lost the internet just before the interviews and had to attend the whole thing on my phone with mobile data.
Round 1 : Apparently, this involved coding too, but then I couldn't code on my phone and somehow, the interviewer agreed to do the "coding" round through a phone call. He asked some questions regarding cached images. There was also a question as to how to make an app that sends different requests to an API in certain proportions. Not going to lie here, the interviewer was very helpful. He agreed to conduct the interview through a phone call and he even helped me through the questions.
Round 2 : This was kind of a mid-way round. I felt most of this round was informal. We started talking about college and some basic questions regarding what subjects I had taken. And then basically, I just explained all the projects I had mentioned on my resume with the interviewer asking some doubts in between. I had a few projects listed on my resume, so I had a lot to explain. She didn't ask many questions actually.
HR Round : This was just an informal meet and greet kind of session. I hadn't turned my cam on for the rounds before this one and so she asked me to turn on my cam for a moment (just to see me I guess?). And then it was just an informal chat about the place I live and stuff.

Total number of rounds : 3
Round 1:
Resume Screening
I kept my resume simple, precise and apt.
You can see my resume here : resume
Around 150 students were selected based on just the resume.
Round 2 :
This was a technical round. We were given three tasks. The Time limit was 3 hours (9am to 12 pm)
Task 1 : Console application for student management using any programming language
Task 2 : Android application which provides permissions granted for all the apps installed on the device using java only. Good UI is a bonus.
Task 3 : A HTTP JSON API for student records with CRUD operations using Golang.
15 students were shortlisted.
Round 3 :
Technical + Personal Interview (On google meet)
There were 5 interviewers.
The interview started with the most obvious but still underrated question 'Tell me about yourself'.
Since, this position was for a security analyst. I focussed and wrapped my skills around things like Linux, I did a Teqip course on cyber security, I do CTFs etc...
Next questions were based on round 2. The complexities of the code etc, I had used arrays, so time complexities were O(n) for CRUD operations of course. They asked me if I could do better. I said I could have used hashmaps etc but couldn't think of that during round 2 hours. Yes, By this time I know I kinda messed up.
Further questions were on my resume. The projects I had done, the hackathons I participated in, the technologies I knew etc which I answered with confidence. They were kinda impressed by all the projects and hackathons stuff.
Next questions were on my developer experience like
How am I fit for the position ?
If you are stuck at an error, where do you seek help from ?
What kind of errors do you experience when using class components in ReactJS ?
What are Kali tools( I mentioned I explore kali tools and I use them in CTFs) tell me about your experience from them ?
Next was personal interview based on hobbies, How good I can do at team playing etc.
3 people were shortlisted atlas and were offered summer internships.
Tips : Keep a smile always, Don't bluff on your resume, Even If you do, just at least know the basics there. The interview was more about how confident I was. So be confident.
All the best :)

About Company : Cloudwick mainly Focuses on cloud analytics for Data-Driven Business, Data Lake as a service. They are an AWS certified Advanced Consulting Partner.
Online Test : All questions were MCQs based on SQL, Data Structures & Algorithms, Java, Object-Oriented Programming and Python. No programming questions were asked.
Interview Round 1 : (Technical Discussion)
It was more like a technical discussion and the important things asked were :
Resume and Projects done recently. They asked about every project mentioned in the resume. It would be easier if there are any cloud computing projects to explain as the company is more focused on cloud-native development.
Previous experience (internship, clubs): Mostly related to internships and any technical club activities
Interested subjects in the curriculum: Asked about cloud computing-related topics like MapReduce, containerization.
Knowledge of AWS: Discussed basic AWS building blocks like ec2,s3, IAM roles etc. Boto3 Python module were also asked.
A resume is very crucial in this stage as most of the discussion will happen around things mentioned in the resume. It is good to have cloud-related projects done in Python or NodeJS, also group projects matter too.
Interview Round 2 : (HR)
Usual HR round questions like tell me about yourself, working in a team with conflicting ideas, hobbies etc were asked.

Online Test:
Clone a doubly linked list 
I don’t exactly remember the question but it's based on 2d matrix.
Technical Interview
Round -1
1.Tell me about yourself
2.largest-sum-subarray-least-k-numbers
First, I suggested a brute force approach without prefix sum. 
Later, I suggested a prefix sum approach. But it wasn’t an optimized one, he gave some time to think but I’ve failed to give a better approach. 
Just wrote code for the brute force method.
3. 1003. Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions (Medium)
First, I suggested brute force  using recursion
Later, I suggested optimized versions after spending some time on it.
 Round-2:
1.Tell me about your OS project briefly.
2.Are you good with data structures? Implement stack using priority queue.
3.Implement FCFS scheduling algorithm and calculate average waiting time. Given processes arrival time and burst time.
Round-3(Final round)
1.Tell me about yourself and briefly about your projects.
2.Were all your projects group projects?
3.What was your role in the OS project? How did  you divide your work among yourselves?
4.How would you know when to stop reading and when to start coding?
5.Were all the resources to read provided by your faculty, since it’s a course project?
6.Are there any particular websites you would consult for clearing your doubts or getting info?
7.Apart from this project,do you search about any topics which you  find  interesting ?
8.Tell me an experience where you stuck in your project?
9.Using OOPS , design file system.
   Was told to implement  search functionality.
Search files given extension type/ file size,
Suggested DFS approach to solve this and was asked to write code for it.
TIPS
Ask as many questions as possible regarding the given problem. Speak out loud your thought process, this helps.
Don’t rush. Tell the approach first and then  discuss the edge cases the code should handle and only then start coding.
I would suggest first try coding the brute force solution and obviously the interviewer asks for a better approach, then you could give the better approach, explaining how this method reduces the time/space complexity. 
If you get stuck in between, speaking out loud your thought process helps in getting hints from the interviewer.
After coding your solution, dry run it with an example and verify it’s working fine with all the edge cases too. You need to know the time/space complexity of your code, it’s a must. Only after this, you should say that you have solved the problem with your interviewer.
While answering behavioural questions, you need to have a story/experience backing it up, else you will be caught easily. Try to answer these a bit realistic and practical, not like directly copy-pasting google answers. 
Ask questions to the interviewer at the end, which shows that you have researched about the company.

Consider for FT: Yes
Online Assessment:
The test was conducted on an internal Amazon site and the test duration is 3 hours. The test consists of the following sections:
Code debug: In this portion of the online assessment, which takes approximately 20 minutes to complete, you will be asked to find bugs in seven pieces of code.  You will have the choice of viewing code in Java, C++, or C. To complete the assessment, you may use online resources that are publicly accessible to everyone.
Coding Test: This portion of the online assessment consists a coding section using Java, Python, C#, or C++ and will take approximately 70 minutes to complete. During the coding section, you may use online resources that are publically accessible to everyone. You will be asked two coding questions to solve.
Work Style Assessment: This is a Psychometric test to evaluate a candidate's cognitive and mental ability. This is built around Amazon’s Leadership Principles, and typically takes 10-15 minutes to complete. In this section, they ask you to choose to what extent a provided statement represents your work style
Logical Ability: During this logical ability section, which should take you 35 minutes to complete, you will be asked a series of problem solving multiple choice questions. This section contains aptitude based questions, paragraph/table/graph based questions, questions based on communication skills etc. Speed of completion for each question is not a factor in your score.  Complete as many as you can during the time allotted.
Technical Interview:
This is a virtual interview conducted on Amazon chime and a link to a whiteboard is provided where you'll be live coding. The interview session lasts approximately 45-60 minutes. This is a straightforward interview where you’ll be asked a set of questions to test your knowledge on data structures, algorithms, problem solving ability and coding practice. You’re required to understand the question, come up with a solution and implement the solution using a basic programming language like C. 
Personally, I was asked 3 questions, two were based on BST and the other on Back-tracking algorithm. They do not specify which data structure or algorithm to use, you have to figure that out. 
One of the questions asked on BST was
Given a BST, find the sum of all the nodes in a level, do this for all levels(Level sum problem)
Question on Backtracking algorithm
Given a matrix M, the matrix contains a start and end point S and E respectively and blocks X. Find the shortest path between S and E. The path should not contain cells that have X.
Finally, you’ll be given a chance to ask a question to the interviewer.
In my case, these were the only rounds conducted(Online Assessment and Technical Interview). There is a chance they could conduct further rounds on behavioral interview techniques. You will be asked to describe a situation you were in, tasks you had to do, actions you personally undertook in that situation and the results you achieved from these actions. The behavioral questions will relate specifically to Amazon’s Leadership Principles and you are likely to cover technical elements in relation to the role in your answers.
Suggestions:
Prepare well before you attend any round.
It is recommended that you go through Amazon’s Leadership Principles before the test or interview.
In the technical interview, while answering coding questions, let the interviewer know your thought process. Let them know how you are approaching the problem and if you have written a piece of code explain about it. Try to maintain this rapport. Because if you get stuck, they’ll provide you with hints. Keep a lookout for those hints.
All the best for your placements!!!

Round 1
It consists of the following 4 parts.
Code Debug:
In this portion of the online assessment, which takes approximately 20 minutes to complete, you will be asked to find bugs in seven pieces of code. To complete the assessment, you may use online resources that are publicly accessible (e.g. the JDK or STL), but, please do not access sites that require a login or are private repositories (Note: Browser usage is logged). I would encourage you to manage your time wisely. If you get stuck on a code debug problem, move to the next problem and revisit questions as needed. You will have the choice of viewing code in Java (Java 1.8), C++ (GCC 8.1.0), or C (GCC 8.1.0).
● This part is mostly easy.
● Basic understanding of the programming concepts is sufficient enough to answer these.
● This part mostly will not require use of online resources or preparation.
Coding Test:
This portion of the online assessment consists a coding section using Java, Python, C#, or C++ and will take approximately 70 minutes to complete. During the coding section, you may use online resources that are publicly accessible to everyone (e.g., the JDK or STL), but please do not access sites that require a login or are private repositories (Note: Browser usage is logged).
● There were 2 coding questions.
● I don’t remember the exact questions.
● My first question is a moderate one which just involves understanding the problem and implementing it using HashTable. I have used python for this question.
● My second question is based on connected components in graphs. I have used C++ for this question.
Work Styles Assessment
This is built around Amazon’s Leadership Principles, and typically takes 10-15 minutes to complete. In this section, they ask you to choose what extent a provided statement represents your work style
● There are 14 leadership principles that were followed in Amazon.
● Attend the ppt and go through some online resources. Read Amazon Leadership Principles
● Don’t spend more time on this for preparation. Mostly you will be rating the given statement.
Logical Ability
During this logical ability section, which should take you 35 minutes to complete, you will be asked a series of problem solving multiple choice questions. Speed of completion for each question is not a factor in your score. Complete as many as you can during the time allotted.
You will not be able to skip and return to questions.
● This part is easy.
● It only has logical reasoning questions. Mostly concentrate on logical ability questions.
● I got a few time consuming questions at the start but I was able to complete all questions in time.
Round 2
This is a Technical interview round.
Question 1
Check if a given Binary Tree is SumTree
Description
Write a function that returns true if the given Binary Tree is SumTree else false. A SumTree is a Binary Tree where the value of a node is equal to the sum of the nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree. An empty tree is SumTree and the sum of an empty tree can be considered as 0. A leaf node is also considered as SumTree.
Link
Refer C/C++ Program for Check if a given Binary Tree is SumTree
Note
● Make sure that you understand the question completely by asking for an example.
● You will be given an online plain text editor. You have to write the code in your language
of choice or pseudo code.
● It is a recursive program which is similar to the ones you would have implemented in second-year CSE. You will be asked for the time complexity and its explanation.
● At the end, you will be asked to do a dry run for a given example.
Question2
Binary Heap and its Operations
Description
What is the Min/Max Heap? What kind of operation can be applied on them?
How to implement those operations?
Link
Refer Geeksforgeeks - Binary Heap
Note
● The following operations: Insert, delete, extractMin, decreaseKey, buildMinHeap, were discussed.
● I was asked to implement Insert, delete, buildMinHeap along with its dry run.
● I was asked to explain the algorithm for extractMin and decreaseKey.
● Time Complexity analysis has to be done.
Final Remarks
● Coding questions of the Online test and Interview mostly required basic understanding of the Data Structures. Go through all the algorithms and data structures that you have studied in second-year CSE lab and theory along with Time complexity.
● Try to explain the code while you implement it. Communicate your Ideas even though it is not an optimal solution.
● Most of my friends were placed in other companies after round1. You can expect one more interview round as well if there were more students qualified for round 2.

CAMPUS INTERN
AUTHOR : AMAL FRANCIS V UKKEN
CGPA Cutoff : 7.0
Rounds : 4 (1 Coding Test + 3 Interviews)
Stipend : 70000 per month
Round 1 : Coding Test
From what I remember, there were 2 questions and I was able to solve one of them fully and get partial output for the other one.
After the coding test, there were 12 students shortlisted in which 2 were in the waitlist (I was in the waitlist and was lucky to get a chance for the interview). 
Round 2 : Interview
All the interviews were conducted through Cisco Webex. The duration of this interview was nearly 1 hour.
First, we both introduced ourselves. He went through my resume and asked a bit about my projects. Then he asked a few coding questions.
How to find prime numbers under 100.
How to find prime factors of a number.
In both these questions he was only trying to test my approach towards it. Then he asked a puzzle question. It was a question similar to this one https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-18-torch-and-bridge/.
After this, I was asked about my different experiences. I remember a question on my biggest achievement. After that, he asked me if I had any questions for him.
Round 3 : Interview
This round was a very different experience. There was some connectivity problem at the beginning and he asked me to put my phone number in the chatbox. He then telephoned me, and we introduced ourselves. He asked a few general questions and then started asking me technical questions. He asked what the best sorting algorithm was, for which I said merge sort. He then asked me to write the code for merge sort. I wasn't confident to code that, so I asked if pseudo-code was fine and he said that was okay. After some 10-15 mins, I presented my screen ( the connectivity was okay by then) and he looked through my code. He then asked me a puzzle question. After that, he asked me if I had any questions for him and that was the end of this round.
Round 4 : HR Interview 
The round started with both of us introducing ourselves. Things written in my resume were thoroughly checked in this round. I was asked about the projects I had mentioned and the events I had organized under the positions of my responsibility. Few other questions I was asked in this round :
Why Amex?
Tell me an incident when you had a conflict with someone. How did you react to it?
After that, she asked me if I had any questions for her and that was the end of this round.
Few Suggestions
When they ask if you have any questions for them, it is always good to ask. 
Read something about the company in advance.
When they introduce themselves or talk about any of their experiences, pay attention to what they say.
Only put relevant information in your resume. Interviewers pick up questions from what you present in it.
I’ve always felt that there is a factor of luck involved in getting through any interview process. So, don’t be disheartened if you fail. Keep trying and all the best.

Minimum CGPA: 7.00
Stipend: 70000
Date of Visit: 30 Sep 2020
Rounds : Coding Test + 3 Interview rounds
Coding Test : 2 Questions
All interviews were conducted virtually through webex.
Interview Round I   (~30 mins)
I was asked to introduce myself.  The interviewer had questions on OOPS concepts. I mentioned my preferred language as C++. So, there were questions like how polymorphism is achieved in C++, what are virtual functions etc.   There were also questions on Data Structures like Hash table, RB tree and linked lists. She asked about the advantages of doubly linked lists over normal linked lists, which I couldn’t answer immediately. But I answered it later when she asked about the time complexity of node deletion in both types of linked lists. There were also questions on threads.
Interview Round II  (~30 mins)
Once again I was asked to introduce myself. Then, I was asked which programming language I am comfortable with for which I answered C and C++ . Then, the interviewer asked me about the difference between C and C++. 
Then he asked a puzzle. The puzzle was : we have a bulb inside a closed room and have 3 switches outside. We need to find the correct switch for the bulb. He asked me the minimum times I needed to open the door  and check to identify the correct switch. For that question I said two and explained  how it can be done. Then, he gave me a clue that I could make use of the heat effect as well. Then I found it was possible to identify the correct switch by opening the door only once and explained how to do that.
Interviewer also asked about the projects I had done. I had projects in my resume which involved mongoDB and SQL. So, he asked me what is the difference between them and when SQL was preferred?
Puzzle :  https://www.htm-lighting.com/blogs/news/3-switch-for-1-bulb-brain-teaser-riddle
Interview Round III – HR (~40 mins)
Interviewer asked me about the experience until then with the previous rounds of interviews. He also asked about the experience of doing projects in groups. Then, he provided a scenario in which another person and I are working on something which has to be delivered to the client within a deadline. But ,the other person is not doing the job. He asked me how I would proceed. 
I made many suggestions including talking to the person about problems and trying to solve them, adding new people to the team, trying to do the work on my own etc. But he turned down all of those and then I said then it would be better to inform the client that the product can’t be delivered within the deadline. Then he said this is a difficult situation and we need to keep the trust of the clients in the organisation. 
Finally, he asked if I had any questions for him. I asked about the current projects and the interviewer’s experience at the firm [ Suggestion: Please do ask questions when prompted ]

Cisco was the 5th company to come for recruitment.
Minimum CGPA: 7 
4 rounds of screening - 1 Online Test and 3 Interviews.
First was the online test. They asked 2 coding questions and a couple of logical and technical objective type questions. I could pass all the test cases for the first coding question, but did not have time for the second one. The objective questions could be answered relatively fine by practicing on geeksforgeeks.
Quite a few people got selected for the interview ( not sure of the real number ). First was the technical round. They asked if I knew any concepts in operating systems and networks. I said I only knew networks from the workshops Cisco conducted and nothing else as the courses had not been taught yet. They then asked some questions based on C/C++ such as static and local  variables and such. They asked a few standard interview questions like:
 Count the number of 1’s in binary representation of a number. 
Given a linked list with each node having an extra pointer to a random element in the linked list too, replicate the linked list
Selection Sort Algorithm.
I didn’t know the second one, so they helped me with some logic. They seemed to be testing my ability to think of a logical solution more than actually expecting an answer. Thinking out loud helps so that they know what’s on your mind. They also asked about the data structures I knew and asked a question or 2 about priority queues and trees. Then, I was asked a few questions from my projects on my resume. That concluded the first interview. Not everyone got called back for the next interview.
The next round was the managerial round. They first asked about some database project in C++ that I had made. They asked how it would be expanded using cloud technology. They asked the pros and  cons of using cloud technology. Then, I was asked a few questions on inheritance. Next, I was given a logical puzzle to solve. I needed some help but I got there in the end. Finally, I was asked if I had done any community service work, I spoke about my NSS coursework and then the interview ended.
Finally, it was the HR round. I was asked a few questions about myself and my goals in my career. It was quite short and then it ended. The results came out at night and around 15-20 students from B.Tech and MCA were selected in total.
Most helpful was geeksforgeeks company-wise interview and coding questions and their interview diaries. Also, a few videos on networking on YouTube were of help.

1 Online test and 3 interviews.
My summer internship interview experience started off with an online screening test. The test consisted of two parts: first one was coding, and the second was general aptitude and technical questions.
On simple analysis, it could be seen that the coding questions were competitive coding questions. The questions didn't dive deep into data structures and algorithms; rather they stuck on the surface level asking competitive coding questions related to arrays and linked lists. There were two questions and I was able to solve the first question, passing all the test cases. However, I could not pass all the test cases in the second question. The second part of the online test was general aptitude and technical based questions. The general aptitude questions were of medium difficulty and since time is of the essence it is better to leave a few questions and attend the questions that you know first to get a better score for the technical questions. I was asked questions from networking, operating systems, general C programming language and so on. I passed the online test and in fact, a number of candidates who answered the first coding question correctly and were able to get all the test cases passed the online test.
My three interviews were conducted on a separate day, as it was for everyone. A point that I kept in my mind while sitting through the interviews was that in Cisco interviews, the interviewers judge you based on how much you are able to communicate your thought process through to them. The first round of my interview was a technical interview. Through the Webex meetings app, I was asked to share a whiteboard and on that I was asked to write a program. The program that I was asked to write was finding the center element of a linear linked list. At first, I wrote the code for this using a simple counter and just one pointer, however the interviewer wanted a different approach for the same solution so I had to change my code to incorporate two pointers to find the middle point of a linked list. She seemed pleased with that answer and went ahead to ask me a few technical questions. She asked me questions relating to networks, operating systems, and general C questions. I was not able to answer many of the networks or the operating systems questions as the year had just begun and the courses had also just started but as I said earlier, I communicated my thought process to the interviewer and due to this she understood that I had an idea of the topics. She acknowledged this by saying "I see that you have an idea but not the exact answer". She then proceeded to look through my resume and commented " You seem to have done a few interesting projects, please wait for the next round. " This was the end of my first round. 
My second round of interview was called the ‘manager interview’. In this round of interview, I was asked questions both technical and from the projects that I had done on my resume. I advise everyone to have a thorough understanding of their projects that they have added on their resume. First, he started off by asking a question related to the first technical question that I was asked during the technical interview. He asked me with two pointers, if it was possible to check that a given linked list was circular or linear, I answered the question and he seemed pleased. He then continued to ask a few technical questions related to C programming. I had answered the first one wrong initially but he continued to ask me without letting me know that I had answered it wrong. The follow up questions made me realize that I had answered the first question wrong. So, I pointed that out and corrected my mistake. He seemed very pleased that I went back to the question and corrected that answer. He then asked me questions from one of my projects. He wanted to know how I had done my project. This project was done during my 4th semester and he asked questions from every nook and corner of the project as if he wanted to develop an understanding of the project. Further, he asked me if I wanted to know anything about Cisco, for which I proceeded to ask a couple of questions about Cisco. He also seemed pleased with my interview and told me to wait for further communication.
My last round of interview was the HR interview. This interview was relatively small and did not contain any technical questions. I was asked questions such as where I would like to work if I was selected, etc. This interviewer also proceeded to ask me if I had any questions related to Cisco, for which I again asked a few questions. This was my Cisco interview experience.

TECHNICAL UNDERGRADUATE INTERN
AUTHOR: MATHEW JOSE MAMMOOTTIL
Preliminary Round: 
For the preliminary round, we had a coding + aptitude test conducted on HackerRank. They had given us 2 coding questions, one which deals with Array / String manipulation. The other coding question was https://www.codechef.com/problems/H1. Along with this, MCQs were also asked for which it is important to know about basic OS, DSA and NETWORKS concepts. 
After the preliminary round, they selected students for the Technical Interview Rounds. This was conducted on Cisco Webex Teams.
Round 1:
In the first round of the technical interview, they started by asking me about some of the data structures I studied in DSA and asked me to show how certain operations in data structures took place. They will ask us to use Cisco Whiteboard ( which allows us to draw) on Webex to show our ideas more clearly. One of the questions they had asked was to implement a Stack using Queue. They also asked me about a few OS concepts as they had seen I was working on the eXpOS Operating System. They will give us enough time to answer so take your time in answering. 
Round 2:
In this round they asked me questions based on my resume. In my experience, this round they mainly focused on all the projects I had done and what my contribution was to each of them.  They will ask us to give a detailed description on a project and it is very important that you put projects in your resume if there was any significant contribution. They asked me about hashing and its practical use to solve problems. 
Round 3:
This was the HR round where they would ask us questions on working in teams, why we choose the company, our preferred place of work.
Some Tips I found Helpful:
Be confident in your answers and take time in answering a question.
While answering a question, they may ask follow-up questions so try to prepare well beforehand.
Only put relevant information in your resume as they critically analyze it.
Be confident in your answers and try to provide justifications for the method you have chosen in your answer.
Try to read about the company in advance.
No placement articles in this issue, as all offers were PPOs.

SEP SUMMER INTERN
AUTHOR : MP HARSHAVARDHAN
JP Morgan Chase & Co. announced that they wouldn't be conducting their regular campus recruitment drive for internships this year (for 2022 graduating batch). Instead, the recruitment would be done based on a 24 hr hackathon named "Code for Good" 
All the eligible students (cgpa > 7) gave the first screening test within the campus in the month of January, 2020. The test consisted of general aptitude and 2 competitive coding questions (to the best of my memory).
Selected students received mails that contained a detailed guide on how to go about giving the next round of interview. 
This interview (ending or the early weeks of feb) had to be pre-recorded by us using the given instructions and link. We were given only 2 chances to record the video after getting the question and send it to them. The duration of the video was limited to 2 minutes, to the best of my memory and it had only 2 questions. The nature of these questions were not technical. It was more personal and related to a collaborative work environment. 
One question goes something on these lines :
You have a team and one of your team members had a situation that was very personal and urgent to him. On the other hand, there was some strict deadline related to your project. Your team member, on one hand, was kind of helpless with his emotional situation and your project, on the other hand, had to be submitted within a few hours or days. 
So how do you tackle this ?
The other question was about your personal goals for the coming few years and how you imagined yourself down the line in your corporate career. 
So the main things that I felt were tested at this stage were our communication skills (top priority) and the content obviously (how practical you sounded).
Most of the candidates must have had good sensible answers but they couldn't make it due to their bad soft skills (as perceived by the recruiter).
Covid set in and we returned to our homes. There was no contact from the firm regarding the final selected students for the hackathon due to the ongoing challenges in the country. 
We received the list sometime later and only around 35 people from the entire batch made it to the hackathon as far as I remember. These students received the upcoming communication directly from the firm.
The hackathon was scheduled in the first/second week of August, 2020. It was supposed to happen at the 3 campuses of the firm for 3/4 days. This time, it was held virtually. 
Hackathon Experience : 
We were randomly divided into teams. I had 6 more folks from different colleges along with me. 2 days prior to the main 24 hr event, we got connected to our mentor as well as our team members. We discussed various things, especially about our interests and the different technology stacks that we were familiar with. 
We were kind of sure that the hackathon event was going to be based on building a web/mobile application/solution to the assigned client. I was familiar with Node.js, Express.js backend frameworks and MongoDB database. I had good touch with the native front end stack too (html, css, bootstrap).
I made sure that I was active enough on the zoom calls with our team members and our mentor. I also tried breaking the silent atmosphere (whenever it happened) by asking some fun questions about their ongoing life, college acads, and so on and so forth. 
Even with my mentor, I've tried to be as honest as I could with whatever it is that I was doing in my life back then. Fortunately, our mentor was chill too. We bonded with him instantly. He made sure that we got comfortable with him.
The main event kickstarted at around 7 AM sharp. We knew that it was going to be extremely exhausting by the end of the day because we would not be given a break the entire day. 
At the beginning, different clients (the non profits, in this case) were introduced to us. Each non-profit organization had one problem statement under them. These statements weren't created for the purpose of a hackathon. It was already existing within their to-do list. So the sole purpose of this hackathon was to come up with a minimalistic working prototype that would further get picked up by the JPMC employees (under their "force for good" program) and worked out for a tenure of 6-8 months to deploy the production version of it. This would be utilised by the respective NGO for their purposes.
Different problem statements were shown to all of the participants (teams) of the hackathon, out of which each problem statement could accommodate around 6/7 teams under it.
This selection was done based on a first come first serve basis. The team that comes up with the best prototype, as decided by the panelists, would end up as the winner. Since there were around 7-9 NGOs, the number of winners was the same.
We chose a statement whose NGO dealt with waste management services and innovation of that (something along these lines).
The statement went something like this : A platform with 3 different user hierarchies (admin, worker, viewer) and every user type had their own exclusive functionalities. Admin user type should be able to create different customisable questionnaires for different locations. Each location would have a worker who could update the ongoing status of the work inside this questionnaire. Viewers only get to view the content with no edit permissions.
This data should be accessible to all the users and it should also have different filter options (based on time, date, location). Charts, graphs and such things could also be leveraged to present this data to the users.
We've decided to go with this tech stack after a brainstorming session.
Frontend : Native HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
Backend frameworks : Node and Express
Database : MongoDB
We got divided into 2 teams (frontend and backend). The front-end team would design the web pages and screens required for the app. Backend folks were responsible for creating different route handlers, authentication process, modelling of the database and the creation of the web server in its entirety.
We have designed our plan of the day and what features we would like to integrate in our application.
I chose to go with the backend team (though I wanted to handle the front end) because only 2-3 of us had ideas on the backend technology. The rest of them had minimal ideas on the front end. Front end team got into a different zoom room and same with the backend team.
I took up the initiative of communicating the backend progress with the front end team.
Our mentor told us that he would be checking in with us once every hour. Each one of us was working on our respective tasks. We had to google different things that we were not aware of or forgotten about. We used to communicate our status with our mentor and he, very subtly, used to remind us of the fleeting time.
It was around 2PM in the noon. I've informed my team and our mentor that I was going to have my lunch and that I'll be back in 15 min.
Once I was back, our mentor started calling each member to his zoom room and he spent around 7 min with each member (like a HR round that happens with conventional interviews).
He basically wanted to know how I was feeling about this event, my future career interests and anything that I would like to ask him about. I did ask him one question about his stay with JP Morgan and what did he liked so much within this firm. He gave his explanation and we were done. 
We were hooked on our screens from the morning. The time was around 8:45 PM and we met with our mentor to show him our prototype that we have built. We couldn't manage to integrate all the features that we had planned in the morning due to time constraints. We had a challenging time dealing with the merge conflicts that arose multiple times throughout the day. 
Something crazy happened at the last minute. The last commit on our team GitHub repo had something messed inside it due to which the functionality got disturbed. We didn't know whose push caused it. 
Everyone panicked all of a sudden because we had to submit the repo link by 9PM sharp and here we are with this crazy issue. The time was around 8:57PM. I, along with another team member, didn't panic at all and we were calm.
My mentor observed the situation and asked us to cool down. He assured us that he'll communicate this to the respected people and perhaps allow us to upload the link post the "pitch" that was about to happen in 5-10 min.
Someone from the team had to present the demo to the panelists. Everyone quickly pointed at me to take up this initiative because I sort of knew the in and out about this app and everyone believed that I'll be able to do a better job in delivering it coz I had good communication skills too. 
After the pitch, my mentor immediately called me and said that I did great. Later in the team call, he told us that Harsha (me) had nailed it and the presentation was nothing less than any corporate presentation that he had witnessed throughout his corporate career. We had an unfinished average product but my honesty and my way of delivery bagged quite a good impression. 
We couldn't make it to the finals as expected. We had to record another walkthrough video demo and upload it by the end of that day. It was 1AM and we were finally done with work. It was too exhaustive and it hurt our backs badly.
The hackathon ended. We received some goodies (after many many months) as a token of participation.
It was after a month or two, I received an internship offer from the firm. 
Key takeaways from my experience : 
1. Try to engage with the people around you. Don't be of the opinion that only the HR round matters in these kinds of hackathon events. Nope, things go noticed right from the start. This doesn't mean you fake too much. Your vibe would easily be caught by the mentor/employer/fellow team mates, whenever you pull off somewhere like that. Network actively but be aware of that boundary line.
2. In group events like these, take stands in multiple contexts, multiple times. Expose yourself to the crowd. Don't be afraid that you'll be embarrassed if you commit any mistake with regards to your communication or any technical stuff. People wouldn't remember you after this event. It's okay to make mistakes. It's not okay to miss out on the opportunities that come right in front of you.
3. Honesty. When I was pitching to the panelists, I kept it very straight about what we did and what we couldn't do. People like it when you're being honest with your work. You want to know why ? Put yourself in the shoes of the employer and imagine that you're interviewing someone. You'll understand.
4. Never hesitate to ask anything to anyone. If you don't ask, the answer is always no. Reach out to people via pings and seek help from them. When you ask some subject expert something, that'll only help you reach your destination way more quickly. 
If someone judges you for the silly questions that you're asking, it's a sign that he/she doesn't respect your learning process. Nothing to worry from your end.
These are very subtle points that are not usually discussed, yet they go very much noticed and considered quite a lot while judging someone's worth as a potential hire. Technical skills are not the only weapon that'll help you steal the trophy. I would say, your soft skills, attitude and the way you put yourself out there matters a lot too.
Good luck and have fun at the event. Cheers

APPLICATION DEVELOPER- FULL TIME
AUTHOR : RAHUL PRADEEP
■ CGPA Cutoff: 7.0 
■ CTC - 27.5 LPA (15.5 base + 6 Bonus + Stock options) 
○ Other benefits - 2L Relocation bonus, travel, insurance etc. 
■ Job Profile: Oracle hired for 2 positions. Server Tech and Application Developer. We had an option to apply for both positions. I applied only for the Applications role. 
■ Online Round: 
The online round was for almost 1.5 - 2hrs and it was hosted on their own platform. The exam consisted of Logical Reasoning, Quantitative questions, Verbal, CS concepts and debugging type questions. Each section had a particular time limit and we couldn’t navigate to previous sections and re-attempt the questions. 
Time management is an important factor during the exam. Be thorough with basic concepts of DSA, OOPS, DBMS, OS etc. and for the verbal part, read the questions carefully and manage time. 
Around 45-50 people were shortlisted for both the roles. Based on the marks obtained, they’ll assign the candidate into server tech or applications for those who applied for both the job profile. 
■ Online Interview: Due to the Covid situation, the interview was conducted through Zoom. The Hackerrank Codepair platform was used by the interviewer during interviews. 
○ 1st Round - Technical Round (1 hr): 
My first round interview was delayed for around 1.5 hr since the interviewer had some connectivity issues on his side. The interview round started with self-introduction and discussion about my projects. We had a good discussion on the projects that I did ( mostly web applications) and he asked me to redesign one of my projects based on the specifications given by him. He wanted to test my ideas on what type of Database I would use, the relationship between different modules and classes, middleware, security aspects etc. 
After that, he gave me 2 coding problems to solve which were quite easy and few SQL queries to solve. He asked me about OOPS concepts and also to explain with an example. Finally, he asked me to solve a few puzzles and one logical reasoning question.
○ 2nd  Round - Technical Round ( 1.5 hrs) 
This round was very long and tiring. The interviewer was an alumnus of our college and the round started with an informal talk about college life, hostels, Kattangal etc. He asked me to walk him through my resume. He was particularly interested in my projects and asked me to give a detailed explanation about the implementation. 
There were a few of my projects related to Angular JS and Ruby on Rails. He asked me concepts related to MVC Architecture, design, the interaction between modules, connection to DB (scenario where we use noSQL and SQL), authentication etc. Afterwards, he told me to design the 'RedBus' Application. He insisted on using Class type implementation and wanted to test my knowledge of OOPS concepts. After that, 
● 2 Coding questions followed by rapid-fire of basic concepts in C++ (or Java whichever you are familiar with). 
● SQL queries, DBMS concepts. 
● OS related questions (Scheduling algorithms, Memory, IPC mechanisms, deadlock etc) 
● 2 Logical questions. 
○ 3rdRound - Technical + HR (45min) 
This round was conducted by a senior member of Oracle (I think he was VP of one dept.). He told me to give a 5 min self-introduction. Straightaway he went to test my coding skills. He gave me 3 coding problems (1 easy, 2 medium) to solve and he would run the code against a few test cases. Please keep in mind about the corner cases while you code and provide comments so that the interviewer can follow your code. 
After that, he asked about my extracurricular activities, participation in clubs, technical fests etc. followed by a few HR questions (long term goals, why oracle etc.). 
○ 4thRound - HR (15min) 
This round was a basic HR round. Don’t take this round lightly as they test your communication skills. She asked why the Applications role and not the Server Tech role. She asked about one achievement that I'm proud of during my college days. After that, she gave me a quick insight about what to expect in Oracle, and
asked about which location I preferred among Bangalore/Hyderabad/Pune and why that location. 
They took 7 students for the Application role and 8 students for Server Tech role. 
■ Tips: 
○ Resume matters a lot. Make sure it looks good and avoid unnecessary details. Don’t lie in your resume and make sure you know everything related to the projects mentioned there. 
○ If you don’t have many projects in your resume, be thorough with CS concepts, improve your coding skills etc. 
○ Be confident and never lose hope if you don't get a few questions during the interview. (Even I wasn’t able to answer a few questions). Don’t make up your own answers and openly tell them you don’t know the answer to it. They’ll test your knowledge from other areas. 
○ Interviews are 60% luck and 40% your knowledge related to their job profile. So don’t lose hope if you face rejection from a few companies. 
All the best for your interviews!!!

PROJECT INTERN - APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT
AUTHOR : ADARSH JOSHY
Job Title: Project Intern - Application Development (Oracle came with 2 job roles in my year, project intern - application development and project intern - server technology)
Minimum CGPA: 7.00
Rounds: 4 (1 Online Test  + 3 Interviews)
Round 1: Online Test
It was a 2-hour MCQ-type test conducted on the Oracle test platform. It consisted of various sections (we could attempt the sections in any order) - Aptitude, Comprehension, DSA (I remember questions on BSTs and Red Black Trees!), OOPS, DBMS, OS and Networking.
Round 2: Technical Interview 1
It was conducted on CoderPad (https://coderpad.io/). The interviewer had prepared problems on the topics: strings, bitwise operators, sorting algorithms and BSTs.
Next, he asked me to explain the projects that I had mentioned in my resume and asked me questions related to it.
Round 3: Technical Interview 2
This time the interviewer asked me to present my screen and open my preferred code editor.
Questions: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-large-number-represented-string/
Swap 2 numbers using Bitwise XOR (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-two-numbers-without-using-temporary-variable/)
Next, the interviewer moved onto Puzzles:

PROJECT INTERN- SERVER TECHNOLOGY AT ORACLE
AUTHOR : VIMAL RAJESH
CGPA Cutoff:7.00
Stipend: 50000
Possible Locations: Bangalore, Hyderabad, Noida, Pune
Online Round:
An online aptitude test was conducted on their platform, which covered DSA, Core CS Subjects and English. It was an MCQ test and was fairly easy. Around 50 were shortlisted for Interviews for both Server Technology and Application Developer roles in total.
Round 2 (Technical Interview):
It was conducted on Zoom and the interview duration was one hour.
First, I was asked to introduce myself and then he went through my resume. I had mentioned SQL, so he asked me some basic questions on the syntax of SELECT statements and also how to find the person with the second highest salary of an employee in a company. Then, we moved on to some coding questions where I was asked to code traversals of a Binary Tree (inorder, preorder and postorder) and then asked me to write code on mirroring a binary tree. Following this round of questions, he asked me a question on Stock Buying Selling to maximise profit where we were given the cost of the stock of a particular day for a week. I was able to discuss and moderately solve it when I was interrupted and asked to talk about my projects. He was more interested in the ALgoalRITHM project and there was a discussion on how I got the idea and how I built it from scratch and the visualization part. Following which, we had a discussion on how the company is and how the work is in general.
I received a notification for the second round of interview in an hour.
Round 3 (Technical + HR Interview)
Again, started with the introduction of myself. The interviewer was extremely energetic and appreciated out of the box answers. Following the introduction, I was given a minute and was asked to tell him the most interesting fact about myself. I replied by saying I probably know more linguistic languages (7 in all) than programming languages. He was intrigued and was quick to search something in French (I had mentioned it in the 7) and asked me some basic translations to check if I was not faking. And then he asked me to think out of the box and frame my own question and answer to it. I asked if my problem statement of my Project ALgoalRITHM would suit the same, and he told carry on. And the discussion of the project went for a while as we shared similar interests in sports and analytics. I was then asked an array coding problem (I don’t recollect exactly) which I was able to solve to an extent within 15 minutes. Following which I was asked few logical questions out of which I could answer 1. (Do check out https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/ to crack interviews at GS and all)
Around 11 PM in the night, I received a notification that I was selected for the Server Technology Role for the summer.
Some general tips:
Asking follow-up questions and having that interaction about post-interview is always nice to do.
Communication skills can help you convey your point better. Project discussions can be extremely vital since you control the flow of the conversation in them.
Refer to geeksforgeeks before the first round of a company to get insights on how the company has been conducting their drives in other colleges where they have visited before us.

SERVER TECHNOLOGY- INTERN
AUTHOR : SAKSHI JHA
Stipend- 50,000/month
Round 1- 
This round was the first online test with MCQ questions and no negative marking. There were sections like computer programming, aptitude, english, technical questions etc. Each section had a fixed time to attempt it. Navigation was off within the section, i.e. each question was compulsory to attempt and you can not go back to the previous question once it was attempted.
In the coding section questions were mostly from input/output questions in Java. In the technical section, there were questions about OOPS and binary search trees.
After the result of round 1 was out, we had a gap of 2 days before the interview. I had revised all the previously asked interview questions from Oracle archives from GFG and Interview diaries and made notes of it
Round 2 (Technical Interview 1)-
It was around 40 minutes. At first the interviewer asked me to introduce myself. This is the best time when you can decide which direction you want to take this interview. I had researched about this company a lot hence I mentioned my interest towards the company. The interviewer started asking me general questions like why Oracle, what all projects is it doing now, please try to attend pre-placement talk carefully, I had picked a few points from pre-placement talk which i told them and they were very impressed. 
These general questions continued for 20 minutes and then he asked me to write a program to merge two sorted linked lists and generate a sorted list. I wrote the program. Then he asked a few other theoretical questions like the difference between a few programming languages, virtual functions, polymorphism etc. 
Round 2(Technical Interview 2)-
As the Initial 20 minutes were the same as the first interview, I said the same thing during the introduction. He asked general questions, then he asked me to convert postfix to prefix. I knew that I didn't remember the conversion part as there is a set of rules you need to follow. I told him, i am not aware, I would like to try but I couldn’t do it. Then he asked me a few questions like the definition of polymorphism, interface, abstract class with examples.
At the end he asked a puzzle, there is 1 mouse and 5 bottles, only one of them has poison and it takes 5 day to die if the mouse eats poison. What would be the minimum number of days it would take to find out which bottle has the poison. He asked if I had any questions to ask him.
What I found out from both interviews is that they just want you to interact with them to know about you. If you are stuck on a question, let them know. And please be prepared with FAQs from company archives. All the very best :)

SUMMER ANALYST- INTERNSHIP
AUTHOR : ASWIN U
Stipend: 1,00,000 per month
CGPA Cutoff: 7.00 
Location: Bangalore (virtual)
No branch restriction
Online Round:
This round was conducted on Hackerrank. There were 5 sections in this round.
Section 1: Questions based on Math and Logical reasoning. The math questions were pretty basic and revolved around concepts of probability. The logical reasoning questions were also easy for the most part. 
Sections 2: This section mainly focussed on Core computer concepts. The questions revolved around concepts like OOP, DBMS, Computer organization & Operating Systems.
Section 3: This round consisted of questions asking for output to code snippets.  
Section 4 (Coding Round): There were 2 intermediate-level questions and 1 advanced question. The first question was based on arrays and comparatively easier for all. The 2nd question was graph-based and revolved around finding the shortest path. The 3rd question was based on dynamic programming.
Section 5: HR related question asking for personal experience with some situations.
Tips: Practice questions and resources on GeeksforGeeks/Hackerrank.
Around 50 students were shortlisted from this round.
Round 1 (Virtual):
This round was conducted using ‘HackerRank code pair’. The interviewer asked questions based on projects I had mentioned in my resume. There were also questions based on probability and a coding question which was a variation of binary search.
Round 2 (Virtual):
This round was also conducted on HackerRank code pair. The questions were mainly based on linked lists such as finding the intersection point of 2 linked lists. The interviewer would ask for the most optimized approach for each problem. There were also a few more questions based on projects that I had done.
Round 3 (Virtual) - Final round:
This round was mainly HR based but there were also a few programming questions thrown into the mix. The HR questions were mostly based on puzzles and logical reasoning. The interviewer went on to ask about the syntax and implementation of various constructs in C/C++, as those were the languages I was most familiar with.
Tips:
Explain your approach while solving a problem. The feedback from the interviewer would then help you to make improvements. The interviewers usually give more importance to your thought process.
Be thorough with the projects/skills mentioned in your resume as that will be the main focus during the interviews.
The aptitude questions were all slight variations of resources that are available on sites like GeeksForGeeks. Try practicing those and you will be able to ace those sections easily.
There will be opportunities to ask questions to the interviewer in each round. Thought-provoking questions at this stage can give a good impression to the interviewer.
All the best for your placements!!!

SUMMER ANALYST- INTERNSHIP
AUTHOR: DIYA JACOB
Some technical questions that I was asked during my interview: 
Derive an algorithm to encode a given string using the frequency of continuous appearance of a character. The example given was Original String: aaabbbccaa, Output String: a3b3c2a2. Implement the algorithm in your preferred language. 
You are given a word and a list of all words in the dictionary. You have to find all anagrams of this word that exist in the dictionary. How will you approach this problem? What data structure will you use?
An orphanage admits kids as they come. When people come to adopt they either want to choose the gender or not. Either way, the kid that was first admitted into the orphanage is given to them, keeping in mind gender, if applicable. What data structure best suits this problem? Implement your algorithm in the language you prefer.
Reverse a singly linked list.
A hexagon has a number at each of its 6 vertices. You are allowed to add or subtract 1 to the numbers at a pair of adjacent vertices simultaneously. Your aim is to bring the numbers at all the vertices to 0. How will you approach this problem? 
You are to select a cricket team of 11 members from a group of 15 people. One person from the group is by default part of the team and there is one other person from the group who you do not want to be part of the team. In how many ways can you select the team?
You have 12 balls that should all, ideally, weigh the same. One of them is damaged such that it weighs more than the other balls. The balls are weighed in pairs to determine which one is damaged. What is the minimum number of weighings required to find the damaged ball?
Other general questions I was asked:
Why Goldman Sachs?
Why should we take you?
How do you manage academics and extra-curricular activities? What difficulties have you faced while doing so and how have you overcome them?
7 friends bring you a birthday cake. You are to cut the circular cake into 8 equal pieces. You only get 3 slices. How do you do it? 
Questions about projects/hackathons you mention in your resume. I was asked to brief the interviewer on J.P. Morgan Chase's Code For Good Hackathon I had participated in.
What is your favourite subject? Why is it your favourite? How have you pursued your interest in that subject?
A few takeaways:
I believe it was important I knew enough about the company to explain why I would be a good fit. 
On the technical side, knowledge of data structures was important. The interviewer pushed to see if I could come up with different or more efficient solutions in both the dictionary and the orphanage question.
Some suggestions:
The interviewers prefer to know how you would approach the problem and hence ask to explain your thought process at every point in time. Avoid long silences while you are thinking.
Knowledge of Data Structures formed an integral part of most of the questions I was asked. If I were to attempt the interview again, that is one topic I would pay more attention to. 
I was also asked a few probability-related questions. I would spend more time on such mathematical concepts as well. While most other companies may not ask such questions, Goldman Sachs does for the Summer Analyst Role.
Extensive knowledge of Data Structures is ideal but do not hesitate to explain your logic or approach to the problem even if you are unsure of how to implement it or are not certain if the data structure you plan on using is optimum. I did stumble over getting a good enough solution to a few questions but I believe talking the interviewer through my thought process was effective. Communicate your ideas, even when you might be unsure of the solution.

SUMMER ANALYST- INTERNSHIP
AUTHOR: S R SIDDHARTH
It had the usual aptitude test followed by 2 rounds of interviews for me. In the first round, they asked me to introduce myself, and then asked me to explain the challenges I faced while doing one of my projects and how I overcame those. Once these were done  we moved to coding problems. The first question was that, a sorted array was given, and then the entire array was shifted to left by some arbitrary k indices. Now the question was to find the value k efficiently.
The solution I used is binary search, since we can exploit the property that the smallest element in the array is the only element whose both left and right element is greater than it. (k= index of the smallest element in the shifted array).
In my second round of interview, they gave me an array where I have to return a new array such that A[i] contains the nearest greater element A[j], such that j>i. This problem I solved using stack. The next coding question I got was the "inversion count" problem, which I solved using merge sort, since we have already practiced this problem in our program design lab.
After these coding rounds, I had a puzzle round, where I was given 2 jars containing 50 blue gems and 50 red gems respectively. I was asked to reorganize these gems such that, if we randomly pick one gem from any of these 2 jars, the probability of getting the blue gem is maximized. The solution I came up with is to put one blue gem in one jar, and keep the remaining 49 blue gems and 50 red gems in the second jar. So, now the probability of getting blue gem is 1/2*1 + 1/2*49/99  ~ 0.75.

SUMMER INTERNAUTHOR: HEMANTH KUMAR J
There were 3 interview rounds and an HR round after the initial assessment test.
The first test consisted of 1 question which we had to explain and solve in a language of our choice. I went with Python. They expect us to solve it while explaining each step you do and what you think. If you get stuck, they'll give you some guidance on how you may proceed. After 45 mins or when you have completed implementing your logic, they run your code against their test cases.
The second round started with solving 2 questions with a different interviewer followed by questions on projects and languages mentioned in the resume. For example, I was asked OOPS concepts when I added Java to my resume. There were also a few general questions in this section.
The third round was fully on DSA skills. Two interviewers ask back to back questions and give a few problems to write algorithms on.
Finally the HR round was on basic questions about the resume and other non-technical skills.
No placement articles in this issue, as all offers were PPOs.

SYSTEMS ENGINEER INTERN 
AUTHOR : PAVITHRA RAJAN
Stipend: Rs 1,00,000 per month
Additional Benefits: Company-paid accommodation for the entire duration, insurance coverage, breakfast/lunch/snacks, training, domestic airfare coverage (Up to Rs. 12,000)
Number of Rounds: 1 coding test followed by 2 interviews
Round 1 (Coding Test):
A test comprising 26 questions, of which one was a coding question. The coding question went something like this:
Let n be the number of dishes, m be the number of days, and k be the days for which the dish must be unique. After k days, there can be a repetition. Given these constraints, return the number of ways the n dishes can be arranged. 
Sample case: If n, m, k are 3, 3, 3, then the number of ways is 6
The coding question was worth 20 points, and the remaining 25 questions were worth 60 points. These questions were based on DBMS, Networks, OS, Computer Organization, Quantitative, Aptitude and System Design. Referring to Geeksforgeeks, InterviewBit and Javatpoint during preparation helped.
16 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2 (Interview):
It started with the usual ‘Tell us more about yourself’ followed by questions based on my last project. It was based on cyber security, so they asked more about encryption, PBKDF2 and SHA256. Difference between HTTPS and HTTP and how it was achieved. Then they proceeded to the following set of questions:
OOPs, concepts and their features. 
Give an example of polymorphism. 
Advantages of DBMS over the conventional file system
Which is faster— C or CPP?
Difference between tree and graphs
Real-life example of graphs (They were impressed with this particular answer)
Why is Python slower?
Difference between interpreter and compiler
Static and Dynamic memory
Do you know git stash and how it functions (I didn’t )
I had mentioned a project which used TensorFlow, so they asked how I learnt it and a few basic questions on it.
The following puzzle was asked, which I could answer correctly. The interviewer tried to confuse me to see how confident I was, but I stayed sure of what I said.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-21-3-ants-and-triangle/
This marked the end of my first interview, which lasted for nearly 35 minutes.
5 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3 (Interview, again):
It started once again with ‘Tell us about yourself’. This was followed by a careful analysis of my resume. Most of my projects were based on Machine Learning and Deep Learning. These were the questions that they had asked:
Difference between random forest and decision tree?
What is Convolution and how does it work in CNN?
How is CNN different from GAN?
What is hyperparameter tuning?
Difference between Logistic Regression and Linear Regression
What is transfer learning? ( I had utilised the VGG dataset in one of my projects, so they asked more about this)
How to combat overfitting and ways to measure the accuracy of a model
Describe a biased model
This went for over 40 minutes (basically, grilled at this point).
Then, they moved on to DSA. They asked how do you find if there is a loop in a linked list.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/
I explained with the Floyd-cycle detection algorithm. They then asked to prove how it guarantees the detection. 
Then, I was asked a question based on Trie.
The interview ended with a puzzle that I could answer.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-7-3-bulbs-and-3-switches/
The whole interview lasted for 50 minutes.
3 students were selected for the role.
Tips:
Be confident. You needn’t know everything. If there is something that you do not know, be open to saying ‘I don’t know’. It’s totally fine.
Do plenty of Leetcode questions (or any platform). This will surely strengthen your DSA skills.
Know your resume inside out. Never bluff.
Both my interviews ended with the conventional question ‘Do you have any questions for us?’. Do prepare one if you can.

Number of Rounds: 3 (1 online test + 2 technical rounds)
Round 1: Online Test
The online test had 4 sections. The entire test was conducted on the Hackerrank platform.
The first section tested one's coding capabilities, there was one coding question and 30 minutes was allocated to it. The coding question was a relatively easy combination problem with some optimization. 
The other three sections were based on aptitude, technical and system design.The aptitude and technical section had 10 questions each and twenty minutes was allocated for both. Most of the questions in the technical section were from DSA and computer organization. The system design section had 5 questions and lasted 10 minutes, it included questions from operating systems and networks. 
I was able to solve the coding question, and was able to attempt most questions in the other sections. 
Around 16 students were shortlisted.
Round 2: Technical Interview 1
There were a total of three interviewers and this interview lasted for about 25 minutes. They were very friendly. They started by asking me questions on the projects I had mentioned in my resume. They asked me what my role was in the team, what was the problem we tried to solve and what were the tech stacks we chose and why. Because I had mentioned proficiency in C++ and C, they started asking me questions on that. They asked me what differentiated the two, I answered that one was an Object Oriented Programming Language while the other was procedural, they then followed up with OOPS concept questions. They piggyback on things you respond with so be ready for follow up questions on every answer you give.
I was able to answer most OOPS questions. They asked if I knew what friend functions were, I responded I wasn’t. 
I had expressed my interest in ML so they asked me to talk about a real-life problem that I could solve with ML, and how I would go about doing it. Then they went back to my projects, because I had talked about using a database there, they asked me how I would protect a database from malicious users, I wasn’t confident with the cybersecurity aspect of databases and responded by saying that I didn’t know. It’s okay to say you don’t know, they don’t expect you to know everything. 
They then asked me in which context C would be better than C++, they also followed up with questions like what was the difference between arrays and linked lists. They told me that they were a company more invested in systems, and wanted to know if I would be willing to work on those kind of projects, companies will only hire you if your interests matches with theirs, you don’t necessarily have to show any previous experience that shows your interest but stating that your would like to work with those technologies and understand them, gives a positive outlook. They ended the interview by asking me about the specks of my laptop. I don't really know why that was relevant but it opened the way for a short but interesting conversation on current laptop technologies. They ended by asking me if I had any questions for them, I replied that I had none.
5 people were shortlisted from this round. 
Round 3: Technical Interview 2
There were a total of two interviewers and this lasted for about 45 minutes. They started by asking me to explain various concepts I had learned from the ML courses I had listed on my resume. They then asked me to talk about the difference between dart and C++ (because I listed app development with flutter as a skill). This then led to OOPS questions on virtual functions, Abstract classes and interfaces (read through geeks for geeks on these topics). They then asked me about the data structures I knew, they asked me about applications of BST. They followed up with questions on hash tables and different collision resolution techniques. 
They asked me how a text editor would know to save a file when you hit save on your computer, it was an OS question, I didn’t know but they said that it was just a tease question and that they were aware that we were yet to learn OS. They ended by asking me a very famous interview brainteaser, It was the three bulb and three switch problem. Then they asked me if I had any questions for them, I asked them what their experience in the company has been like, they both shared their experience and then the meet ended.
Within a few hours, 3 of us were offered internship positions.
Tips: 
Don’t bluff on your resume
Show confidence and be interactive
Most importantly relax, they want you to be able to perform well.

Stipend: Rs 1,00,000 per month
Number of Rounds: 1 coding round and 2 interview rounds
Round 1 (Coding Test):
The total duration of this round was 80 minutes. There were multiple sections which could be attempted sequentially. The first section was a coding question. The other sections included an aptitude test, questions about Linux and other course related stuff.
16 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2 (Interview):
In this round, I was mostly asked questions about the projects mentioned in my resume. They asked me about how I’d implemented those projects and how I’d go about improving the performance of those programs. They also asked a few questions about React. There were a bunch of questions about the principles of OOP and the implementation of these principles in the programming languages I mentioned in my resume.
At the end, they asked me a riddle which I was able to answer (with some prodding in the right direction from the interviewers).
The interview lasted around 40 minutes. 5 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3 (Interview):
This round was a lot more in detail than the other round. They asked me very specific details about each project I had in my resume. I had a music player app mentioned and they asked me how I would change it if I had to accommodate shuffling of a million different files. I was then asked about how I thought Spotify’s backend was implemented (the interviewer then did a quick search and confirmed that my guesses were absolutely incorrect :’) )
I had mentioned a backend I’d made and was asked questions about the difference between SQL and noSQL databases,  REST and GraphQL apis and other related questions.
I was also asked some hardware questions like what a graphics card is and a few OS related questions about swap memory, filesystems etc.
This interview also contained HR personnel and she asked me about my approach to solving problems and issues I’d faced while working on some larger projects.  
This interview lasted about 40 minutes.
3 students were selected for the role.
Tips:
Be very thorough about everything mentioned in your resume.
It’s alright to say you don’t know. I didn’t have a solid answer for half the questions I was asked.

 Number of Interview Rounds = 2
 Round 1 (Online Test): 
Online Coding Round was conducted on HackerEarth.
There were 2 problems.
Duration was 1hr.
I partially solved 2 problems.
 Round 2 (Interview) : 
Both Rounds were Coding rounds.
Was conducted in google-meet and we were to type the code in google docs.
Duration was 45 minutes.
They asked one problem and on completing that, I was asked to explain its time and space complexity.
After that, there was a follow up problem, basically the same problem with few additional constrains and sub-tasks.
The problem was simple.
  Round 3 (Interview) :
Was also a coding round similar to the first round of Interview.
The problem was a bit tough.
I came up with a solution slightly better than brute force. After explaining the code and its time and space complexity, I was asked to optimise the code even further, I explained to him how I was trying to optimise the code (time complexity), I couldn’t come up with the optimal solution in time.
Last 5 minutes, the interviewer asked if I had any questions for him and he answered it after which the interview ended.
Tips 
For the Online Test Round, read both problems before you start and plan what you are going to do accordingly. Don’t spend too much time on one problem.
Have a good resume, the shortlisting is not just based on the Online Test results.
Be very comfortable with any one language, and learn how to use the inbuilt functions and know its time and space complexity.
You won’t be having any auto-complete, hence it is better to practice solving problems without auto-complete.
Try to explain your code as you type it (Interview) and avoid long periods of silence.
Use appropriate naming for the variables.
Listen to what the interviewer says carefully, because he would give hints if you are stuck or are going in the wrong direction.
Don't try to come up with an optimal solution straight away, if you can come up with an optimal solution straight away and if you are confident enough then go with it else try to come up with a brute force solution first.
Have a few questions ready to ask your interviewer at the end of the interview.

The second section had 30 MCQs on computer science topics(OS, DBMS, etc) and we were given 30 minutes for this section. Both these sections had easy questions.
The last section had 2 coding questions. The first question was https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithm-to-find-minimum-number-of-coins/ and I was able to solve it correctly. I don't remember the second problem but it was a bit more complicated and I passed almost all test cases (but not all) for that question.
Around 45-50 candidates were shortlisted from this round.
Round 2(Pymetrics round): In this round, we were asked to play a bunch of games on an online platform. We were evaluated on the basis of our performance in these games. I don’t think any kind of preparation is necessary for this round. You can find out more about Pymetrics on their website.
Around 15 candidates were selected for the interview rounds.
Round 3(Technical Interview): The interviewer asked me some basic questions on DSA and OOP. Then he asked me some questions based on the projects that I had mentioned in my resume. He also asked questions about my non-academic experiences like the club and committee that I was a part of. This interview lasted for about 25 mins.
Round 4(HR Interview): In this round, I was asked some common HR questions like "tell me about yourself " and "what are your strengths and weaknesses". I was also asked about my family background and questions like why did you choose NIT Calicut (and not some other college) and why did you choose CSE. The interview lasted for about 5-6 mins.
Tips: 
DSA and OOP concepts are very important.
Make sure that you have thorough knowledge about everything that you have mentioned on your resume, especially projects. 
Be confident while answering questions in the interviews(Not answering a question is better than giving an incorrect answer confidently though)

Round 1 : 
It was an online coding round in Hackerrank. Had 2 easy-medium level string array manipulation questions. And one theory question on what is the time complexity of the algorithm implemented in the 2nd coding question and how and when to improve it. 
The first question was pretty simple.
The second question: Given an array of phone numbers as strings, we had to find the largest prefix for each phone number from another array of prefixes such that the prefix of a phone number should be present as a substring in the phone number starting from the initial character.
8 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Rounds 2 and 3: 
HR and Technical Interview Round. All shortlisted in the first round had to attend both the interview rounds. Interviews were conducted on Google Meet.
The first interview was a technical round for me. A Leetcode question was shared in CodePair. Implemented the brute force method and ran the code. I was asked to improve it and it took around 30 minutes to get to the improvised code. The interviewer was very supportive and friendly. She helped me by giving hints while I kept my thoughts loud.
Other than solving this one question, no other technical questions were asked. She asked a few personal questions regarding what I told in my introduction. 
In the HR Round, the interviewer was very cordial, funny, and friendly. His easy-going nature really helped me stay relaxed throughout the interview.
Some of the questions were :
Why should we hire you?
Strengths and weaknesses?
A moment of failure in life? How did you overcome it?
Moment of Success? 
What is a hardship you are currently facing in your life?
Situations were given and I was asked how I would act in those situations and to give examples of such situations in my life. These included questions to check my knowledge of DSA too.
Asked 4 names of members of a team project I have worked on. I was asked to be each of those 4 members and to tell 2 positives and 2 negatives of me from their views.
Questions were asked to check if I know about what the company does.
4 students were finally offered the internship.
Tips 
Practice a lot on Leetcode, GFG, and Hackerrank.
Research the company well and listen to the ppt. 
Read the previous interview experiences of the company in GFG Archives(If any) and Glassdoor. (This really helped me prepare for the interview).
Keep your thoughts loud during technical interviews.
Prepare questions to ask when you are told to ask questions at the end of the interview.

Number of Rounds : 3 (1 coding test, 1 HR round, 1 Technical round)
Round 1 (Coding test):
The test round conducted in HackerRank consisted of two easy to medium coding questions and one question asking for the complexities and ways to improve the complexities of the following coding question. The coding questions were mostly based on string modification. In addition to coming up with an optimized solution, try to give attention to the code readability by adding comments wherever necessary.
Round 2 (Technical round):
The interview was conducted in CodePair. After a quick introduction session, we dived straight into the coding question. I was given an easy linked list problem and was able to come up with an optimized solution fairly quickly. Try to think out loud and make sure you have clearly understood the problem and its corner cases before you start coding. Let the interviewer know your exact thought process. The interviewer was very supportive and created a light-hearted and casual environment.
Round 3 (HR round):
The HR round mainly consisted of typical HR questions like:
 How do you handle criticism
 What do you consider your greatest achievement?
 How do you handle disagreements while doing group work?
 Which subject do you like the most and why
 What are your motivations for doing certain projects?
Other than the HR questions, a few technical questions were asked based on what I added to my resume. So be sure to add only the topics you are comfortable with in your resume.
At the end of the coding and HR round, you will be given a chance to ask questions to the interviewer. This is your chance to show your interest in the company and make a good impression on the interviewer.
8 were selected from the first test and 4 were selected for the internship.
Tips:
Practice your coding skills in GeeksForGeeks, Leetcode, and other such sites. You can also refer to books like Cracking the coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann Mcdowell.
Pay attention to the pre-placement talk and research the company through glassdoor and the company website to understand what exactly the company is looking for which will help in the HR rounds.
Many times the interviews are based mostly on your resume, so be sure to add only the topics that you can handle and prepare well on those topics.
There is quite a bit of luck involved in interviews, so never get discouraged if you fail a few times. Success is way more satisfying when you fail a few times anyway :). Just be sure to learn from your mistakes and hope for the best.

Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
 The online test was about an hour and a half. There were two coding questions asked in this round which were moderate. I got those two questions. There is also a theory question, "what is the time complexity of the algorithm implemented in the 2nd coding question and how and when to improve it?".
Round 2: First Interview(Technical)
 The interview rounds were not elimination rounds. All shortlisted in the first round had to attend both the interview rounds.
 This round was completely technical. It was a one-one interview on a Google meet. After introducing myself the interviewer asked a coding question that is similar to the stocks buy and sell problem. The interview was about 45 min long. Solving the question step by step by removing complexities (time and space) took all the time.
Round 3: Final Interview(Behavioral)
 This round was fully nontechnical and lasted around 45 min. It was also a one-one interview. The interviewer asked typical Hr questions which you can find at indiabix website or any other website. The questions were mostly based on the situations you faced in your past.
Tips:
Do coding throughout the vacation, one or two problems a day from Hackerrank or Leetcode.
Be sure what to put on your resume.
Research the company well and listen to the ppt. 
Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of them.
Speak out the solutions in the interview, it is what they see the most.
Prepare for the interview beforehand.
Never lose hope even if you failed at the coding stages in the early companies. I too failed many coding exams and failed a few interviews. Work hard and rectify your mistakes.
Never repeat your mistakes.

First round was an online test which had 4 sections. The first section had 2 easy level coding questions, 30 mins were given to solve both questions, the second section consisted of questions based on DSA, reasoning, probability, PnC, etc. The third section was a medium level coding question and 45 mins were given to solve that question. The last section had questions based on OOP, OS, etc.
                   Round 2 : 
The second round was an interview round. It started with the interviewer introducing herself. The interviewer asked me to give a short intro. Then she asked if I had done any projects. I didn't have any projects worth mentioning on my resume so I had to come up with a good explanation for that.  I was given an easy level question based on sliding window technique.  The interviewer asked for a general then an optimized approach. She also asked some questions on sorting algorithms, like time complexity, space complexity, etc. 
                   Round 3: 
This was also an interview round. The interviewer was super chill. The interviewer gave me a medium level question based on arrays and asked me to come up with a pseudo code first. After that he asked me to write the cpp code and gave a few test cases to verify it. Finally he modified the question slightly (by adding duplicate values to the array) and asked me to make suitable changes to my code. Then I was given 2 test cases to verify the final code. Then the interviewer asked me if I had any questions for him and briefly answered my questions.
                   Round 4: 
This was the final round. The interviewer started by asking me a few puzzle questions (refer G4g) . Then he gave me an easy level linked list question. He asked me to explain verbally all the possible ways of solving the question. (one of them involved reversing a linked list). Then I was asked to code the solution and run it on some hackerrank platform. It had around 14 test cases. After that the interviewer asked me to code it using a different approach. In the end, again the interviewer asked me if I had any questions and took time to answer them briefly. I was facing some network problems so the interview was cut short.
Tips 
Practice easy and medium level coding questions on hackerrank, leetcode.
Attend the company orientation so that you can ask questions to the interviewer about the company.
Communicate with the interviewer about your approach and line of thought while solving a particular question.
Not having any projects in my resume was not a problem for me. Be honest about it  OR  be prepared for questions based on the projects mentioned in your resume.

Number of rounds : 3
    Number of Test Rounds  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Round 1 :
 
This round was an online test conducted on HackerRank. It had five sections. The first section consisted of 2 easy-level programming questions, the second section consisted of mathematical and logical reasoning questions, the third section had 1 advanced-level programming question, the fourth section consisted of 2 HR-related questions, and the fifth section was on computer concepts.
Round 2 :
This was the first interview round. It was conducted on HackerRank code pair. 
The interviewer asked mainly programming questions and some logical reasoning questions too. He also asked some questions about my resume. The programming questions I was asked were a variation of merge sort, to swap two numbers without using a third variable and write a function to perform some simple operations on cartesian coordinates. The logical question I was asked was to find the time when the hour and minute hand of a clock would coincide next after starting from the 12 o’clock position. 
Round 3 : 
This was the second and final interview round for me and was also conducted on HackerRank code pair. The interviewer asked only a single programming question and the entire duration of the interview was spent on the one problem. The question was given a 2D matrix, with each cell representing houses with some number of people and one cell being a fire station, calculate the maximum number of people that can be saved if a fire broke out of a given cell. In unit time, the fire can spread to all eight adjacent cells and the firemen can reach all eight adjacent cells next to a particular cell(they will start from the station). The interviewer would ask to optimize the solution throughout the thought process.
Tips : 
I felt the interviewers gave more importance to the way of thinking and approaching the problem rather than the actual implementation. So think out loud.
Try to optimize the solutions as much as possible.
I felt Goldman Sachs asked more logical reasoning questions compared to other companies, so prepare for those.
Most of the time the interviewers will ask if you have any questions for them, it is always good to be prepared with some questions you would like to ask them.
Be prepared to answer questions from your resume.

Round 1 : 
This round was an online test conducted on HackerRank. It had five sections. The first section consisted of 2 easy-level programming questions, the second section consisted of mathematical and logical reasoning questions ( there were questions based on integration and trigonometry  ), the third section had 1 advanced-level programming question, the fourth section consisted of 2 HR-related questions, and the fifth section was on computer concepts.
The marking scheme was like +5/-2 for MCQ and 20 marks for easy programming questions,
Round 2 :
This was the first interview round. It was conducted on HackerRank code pair. The interviewer directly started asking coding questions. It was to find the second largest element in an array. I coded it fairly quickly but missed many cases such as; what if is no 2nd highest?, if there are more than one 2nd highest?, how to do it without using INT_MAX like constraints….. Etc. I was able to come up with solutions but didn't get time to code them.
Round 3 : 
This was the second and final interview round for me and was also conducted on HackerRank code pair. This interview too was directly into coding, the interviewer asked to only write pseudo code not actual 1 (that was a relief:) ). 
A basic DP problem of traversing the grid from left bottom to right top with max cost path. I explained my approach and coded the solution.
The second was also a medium-level question. The third was :  ( you are given 2 sorted arrays and you need to find the median of an array that is the result of a combination of both.) I found a solution of O(n) but she asked me to optimize it more to reach O(log n) but I couldn't do it (link).
Tips : 
Speak your thought process out loud, and make the interview as interactive as possible. 
After completing coding, say the time and space complexity of the problem and if you can optimize further.

Section 4 : Two HR related questions
Section 5 : Some basic Computer Science question
Round 2 : First Interview (Technical) round.
Interviewer asked some coding questions , mathematical and logical questions. 
Coding question was based on an array. The interviewer gave an array and asked me to print the next immediate greater element for each element. Next Greater Element.
There were some mathematical and logical questions based on our 11th and 12th.
Round 3 :  In the second interview(technical) round , the interviewer asked puzzles, logical and Coding questions.
First question : There is an equilateral triangle having three ants named A, B and C on each vertex. Ants can move only on edges with constant speed. What is the probability that A can go to vertex b without colliding with other ants?What is the mean distance travelled by A in these cases? Ant-Puzzle.
Second Question: There are N people and each person has a value associated contained in Array A of size N. i’th person can be friends with j’th if A[i] % A[j] == 0 or A[j] % A[i] == 0.We have to find for each person how many friends he can make. 
Input :     [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]    Output : [2, 1, 1, 0,  2]
Before ending the interview he asked me some puzzles for which you can prepare from g4g .
         Round 4 :  It was a technical as well as HR round.
Interviewer asked some questions(common HR round questions) like tell me about myself and Tell me something about your projects.
First coding question was based on 2-D array and dynamic programming. She gave me a 2-D array with each cell having an integer value stored. We have to travel from the bottom-leftmost cell to the top-rightmost cell. There will be many paths to travel.Each path will have some cost of travelling which is the sum of integers in each cell in that path. What will be the maximum cost?
Second coding question: There are two sorted arrays. What is the median of two arrays? She asked me to solve it without merging those two arrays.
Tips 
Practice questions on hackerrank, codechef and on any other platform you like.
Practice questions on Data Structure and Algorithm on a daily basis.
In all these interviews, they were focusing on optimising the code. Also they gave some importance to space and time complexity.
If you could focus on dynamic programming questions, that’ll help a lot.
I used to take part in codechef contests sometimes and it helped me improve my logical thinking and coding ability.
Make sure you know about the things you wrote in your resume.
Be confident and calm during interview
ALL THE BEST!!!

AUTHOR : KARTHIK SHUKLA
Stipend : Rs 90,000/month
Additional Benefits: Company paid accommodation, to and fro flight reimbursement and Rs 10,000 wellness reimbursement.
Number of Rounds: 1 + 3 (1 Online Assessment + 3 Interview Rounds)
Round 1(Online Assessment) : 
This round consisted of 3 coding questions and the time given was 90 minutes, the first question was easy, and the second question was medium but a standard binary search question (similar to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/painters-partition-problem/) and the third question was a medium graph-based question.
Interview Rounds :
Round 1 : 
The interview started with an exchange of quick introductions which was followed by a simple coding problem ( the problem was to sort an array of unsorted arrays in non-increasing order ). After I completed my solution the interviewer asked me about the time and space complexity details of my approach and further asked if there was any way to bring down the number of comparisons.
Then the interviewer asked me to design a supermarket management system using OOPS concepts and then further asked some cross questions about my design.
Round 2 :
This was rather a theory-based round and didn't have any DS questions, the interview started with a quick exchange of introductions and then the interviewer asked me the first question which was to design service like TinyUrl. I came up with a solution and the interviewer asked some cross questions about my design. This was followed by some basic DBMS(Normalization, Joins etc), Computer Networks (Round Robin Scheduling Algorithms in Networking etc) and OOPS questions and then the interviewer asked if I had any questions for him and with this, the interview concluded.
Round 3 : 
Like the previous rounds, this round also started with a quick exchange of introductions then the interviewer asked me to explain any one project that I had listed in my resume, then he asked me a DS based question which was : 
Given an array of strings and q queries with each query having a prefix string, design a data structure to efficiently implement the search to print all strings starting with that prefix.
For this question I gave a Trie based approach and implemented a search function using the same,the interviewer seemed satisfied and then proceeded to ask me some space complexity details of my approach and asked if I can improve the space complexity. I took a moment to think then I gave a Hash table based approach in which strings are hashed according to their prefixes. The interviewer proceeded to ask some cross questions related to some hash table concepts(collision resolution, average search time) I answered all of them and then he asked me if I can improve the time complexity of my hash table approach to which I suggested to increase the size of the hash value set which in turn will reduce the average chain length and hence improve the time complexity. The interviewer seemed somewhat satisfied then he asked me to design a hash function which ensures that there are no collisions in the first place i.e we get constant lookup time the answer to which was to use time stamps along with prefixes to hash the strings which (to a large extent) ensures that there are no collisions.
After this, the interviewer asked some networking questions like the difference between HTTP and HTTPS, how HTTPS actually works and then he asked if I had any questions for him and with this, the interview concluded.
Tips:
A strong foundation in DSA is a must so make sure to practice enough questions on websites like Codeforces,Codechef,Leetcode,Hackerrank.
Along with DSA also be prepared with some basics of DBMS,Computer networks and OOPS.
Be clear in communicating your thought process to the interviewer.

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN
AUTHOR : MOHAMMED JAWAD
Stipend: Rs 90,000/month
Number of rounds:  1+3   (1 online coding round and 3 virtual interview rounds)
Round 1 (Online coding round)
Online round consisted of a Hackerrank coding test with a time duration of 90 minutes. There were 3 questions of which the first one was easy. The rest of the questions were of medium difficulty. All students who ended up solving at least 2 questions fully ended up on the shortlist. All three of the problems were standard DSA problems the likes of which are found on geeksforgeeks.org
Round 2 (Interview)
The interviewer started off by introducing himself. I was briefed about the recent developments that had taken place at Salesforce. Subsequently, I was asked to give a self-introduction following which my resume was scrutinized by the interviewer. The first round of interview was quite different for different candidates. Some of us had DSA problems while several others like myself had lots of questions on Computer Science fundamentals.
A range of questions were asked on OOPS concepts on topics ranging from multiple inheritance, polymorphism, function / operator overloading among others. This was followed by some of the commonly asked questions on DBMS. I was asked to explain the importance of normalization, as well as to construct a SQL query. Basic questions from OS were asked but as I was rather unfamiliar with the same, I pointed out that we hadn’t been taught OS yet after which the interviewer shifted on to DSA theory. The total duration of this round was 30 minutes. List of candidates who had cleared this round was released shortly after.
Round 3 (Interview)
This round was kickstarted with an exchange of introductions following which I was immediately given a question to design a rudimentary browser navigation system that facilitated visiting all previously visited websites as well as the option to ‘move forward’ and come back to the original site once back button is used (more or less like how one can hit back button on say chrome to go back to previously visited links and hit forward to revert to the current page) using OOPS concepts. One could implement the same in any language of their choice. I proceeded to implement the aforementioned system using C++ by creating a class and storing links of websites in a doubly linked list to facilitate moving backwards and forward efficiently. The interviewer cross-questioned me on specific implementation details and was seemingly satisfied with the answers. 
I was subsequently asked basic questions on how hash map works, its time complexity , use cases and collision resolution. At the end of the round, the interview asked me if I had any questions for him.
 This round lasted for around 40 minutes most of which was occupied by the OOPS design problem. 
Round 4 (HR round)
This round was handled by one of the senior recruiters at the company and was less intimidating as questions were far less technical. As always, I was asked to give a self-introduction following which the interviewer glanced at my resume and was intrigued by the projects I had mentioned. We had a detailed conversation about one of my projects where the tech stack, design philosophy, challenges faced among others were discussed. The interviewer talked about software engineering principles and practices in great detail most of which went over my head. Going through general HR questions helped. The interviewer proceeded to ask if I had any questions for him following which the round ended. This round lasted for around an hour and most of it was discussion about my personal projects.
Tips
Clearing the online round requires one to have a pretty strong command over DSA as the problems are fairly challenging and time-bound. Solving questions on Geeksforgeeks, Hackerrank, etc and taking part in programming contests is extremely important in order to be able to clear online rounds for companies.
Questions may be asked from topics like DBMS, OOPS and DSA theory. Make sure to brush up on the basics of the same from resources like Geeksforgeeks.
Reading the interview experience of Salesforce on Geeksforgeeks gave me an edge in interviews.
Be prepared to be cross-questioned on all the technical skills and projects mentioned on your resume.
Research about the company you are interviewing for and be prepared to answer common HR questions.

Round 1 : 
The first round was a coding round which had 3 questions.2 of them were pretty easy and one was a medium level question. Unlike other firms' coding tests, the result of the test was shown immediately after the end of it. Those who got 2 questions fully and 3rd one partially were shortlisted for the interview process.
Round 2 : 
This round was an I=interview conducted on Webex. The interviewer mainly focused on my resume. No coding questions were asked during this round. He asked me to rate my skills in each programming language that I have mentioned in my resume and asked questions based on the language which I am most comfortable with. Then, he started asking questions based on the frameworks I mentioned.
Round 3 : 
In this round after my introduction, the interviewer asked me to explain my projects and then gave me a coding question. The question was to print all the permutations of a given string. She also said that built-in functions can’t be used to solve the questions. I was not able to do that so she gave me another question which was to find the loop in a linked list. As this is a typical linked list based question I was able to answer it quickly so she asked me to explain the working of the algorithm to make sure that I know the concept behind the algorithm well. Then I was asked some typical HR questions based on teamwork and my previous experiences.

Tips 
You should be thorough with the projects and the skills that you mentioned in the resume.

Number of rounds: 3
Number of Test Round : 1
Number of Interview Rounds:  2
Round 1 : 
This round was an online test hosted on AMCAT (2 Hours). It had 3 sections:
English - This section was to test your verbal skills like finding grammatical errors, choosing appropriate phrases and passage-based.
Business Aptitude - This section was to mainly test your logical reasoning and decision-making. Questions mostly included graphs, tables and simple arithmetic.
Coding - 2 Questions in 60 minutes. Both questions were easy to medium difficulty level on hackerrank.
Try to score well in the English and Business sections since it’s relatively easier than the coding round. 
Round 2 : 
This round was a mix of HR and technical questions. After I gave a brief introduction of myself, the interviewer jumped straight to a coding question.
He asked me to code the solution for the Coin Change problem(LeetCode Question) and then later on kept altering the question mainly to test the way I approach the problem given the modifications.
He then asked me a couple of questions related to DBMS, inheritance and virtual functions in OOPS.
For the rest of the interview, it was mostly HR questions like why Wells Fargo, short term, long term goals etc and questions related to the extracurricular activities mentioned in my resume.
Since the rounds were of eliminating type, only a couple of students qualified for the next round.
Round 3 :
This round was entirely technical. The interviewer started off with my resume. Since there was a project based on EDA using seaborn, he spent a lot of time asking questions about the seaborn library, different types of visualizations etc. He also asked about the concepts used in data analytics since I had mentioned a course in my resume for the same.
He then asked about time complexities of different algorithms , hash tables , multi-threading ,difference between primitive and advanced OOP concepts, how to test a software and mostly questions from CO about memory, processors etc.
Tips 
When it comes to coding questions, do not hesitate to ask the interviewer if you are stuck with the problem. They are more interested to know the way you approach the problem than getting the final output. So think out loud and communicate as you solve the question
Rather than wasting time, be ready to say that you do not know if you are not sure of the answer and they may give you hints. 
Know your resume in and out. If you add a project, know everything about it.
Spend some time preparing a good self introduction that suits the job profile since it can set the tone for the interview and also direct the line of questions to your area of interest.
Most of the time interviewers will ask if you have any questions for them, so always prepare a couple of questions you can ask them.
Technical knowledge is not all that matters. Don’t feel dejected if you can’t answer a couple of questions. Your attitude and the way you present yourself matter more.
Good luck :)

CTC: 18.6 to 21.80 (varies depending on performance)
Number of rounds: 5
Number of test round:1
Number of Interview rounds:4
ROUND 1 (Online Test):
It was a 90 min test on Hackerrank.
We had to choose two languages out of C++,C and java to code in 
There were seven sections in total.
Aptitude, logical reasoning, Computer Science Fundamentals, C++ and C MCQs (depending on which languages you chose) ,Coding section and additional python bonus section.
Coding section consisted of 2 question and both the questions needs to attempted in different languages.
Practicing on Leetcode and Interviewbit would be enough to crack the questions.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/(1st question)
Second question was on basic rotation of characters in string 
Bonus Python section contained simple input and output questions
IndiaBix would be enough for aptitude
 Focus more on oops concepts
ROUND 2(Group discussion):
We were a group of six (all rounds after online test was elimination round also please listen carefully in the ppt session given by the company and make a note of the points)
Topic: Which one is more important, Technical skills or Soft skills.
Everyone was given 1 min to put out their point.
Be confident with your point, speak clearly and most importantly be confident because nothing is right or wrong. You will be judged on        your ability to put forward your point.
ROUND 3
(HR round):
          
Rounds may be in any order depending on the availability of the interviewer. I had HR round after GD.
2. Basic HR questions were asked like strengths, weaknesses, teamwork etc. For me, we had a discussion about my internship that I did during summer break. 
3. While answering the questions, try to relate to some incident that you have already experienced during internship or while doing any project as a team as that would be quite helpful.
4. What problems did you face during internship, about teamwork, clashes in the team, how you handled it, your contribution etc. were the questions asked for me. It lasted for one hour.
5.One more important point you will be asked is about the  job location you want and Why? Please look through the job description and type of work done in respective locations.
(Technical round):
1.So we had a discussion about my projects and they will be checking how you solve a certain problem or will solve a problem during a project so try improving problem solving skills.
2.After that we had a hackerrank code pair round first question was a basic mathematical question (If ram solve x questions in a day and other person shaym  solves y question in a day and initially  ram is k questions ahead of shyam how many days it will take shaym to overcome ram)
3.Now mathworks mainly focus on OOPS concepts so for me I had to demonstrate multiple inheritance by coding it be careful you must know how to implement oops concepts as you will be made to code.After that I had to demonstrate runtime and compile time polymorphism.
4.Be confident in OOPS concepts.
ROUND 4 (Managerial round) :
As I had already mentioned, do listen to PPT carefully, mostly about Engineering development groups. Most of the questions would be on this.
You will be judged on how you manage tasks, how you prioritize the tasks, how you manage a team etc. Try giving answers by relating to real life incidents according to the questions.
What do you understand by EDG and the different aspects of it were some of the other questions.
This round lasted for 30 mins.
Tips:
Be confident.
Don't try to fake if don't know the answer of the question
Go through some standard HR questions and managerial questions beforehand
Try improving problem solving skills.

INTERN IN ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT GROUP
AUTHOR: HARIMURALI J
Stipend: Rs. 50,000 per month
Number of rounds: 4
 Number of Test Rounds  = 1
 Number of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1: Online Test
The test consisted of 10 MCQs and 2 coding questions. The MCQs were of moderate difficulty. The questions were related to linked lists, binary heaps, binary trees, arrays, sorting, etc. It should not be too difficult if your DSA basics are strong. I don't exactly remember the coding questions, but both were related to arrays. I remember solving both the questions using python dictionaries. The questions should be easily solvable for anyone who has practiced array-based questions from geeks for geeks, Leetcode, etc.
Round 2: Group Discussion
The topic for the GD was something like this: "What are your expectations about working at MathWorks and what made you choose MathWorks?". The pre-placement talk is just before the first round. Make sure you listen carefully and note down important points. This should give you enough points to speak during the GD. Watch videos on youtube to prepare for the GD and to get to know how a GD works. Make sure you understand the dos and don'ts of a GD. Try to initiate the GD. This will give you extra points. Don't tread off-topic while speaking. Give chances to others and also take your chances. Try to speak at least 2 times during the GD and listen carefully when other participants are speaking. Everyone will get a chance to conclude. While concluding, please do not add extra points. Always conclude by summing up all the points talked about during the GD. Be calm, do not panic, and if you follow the above steps you should be easily able to clear this round
Round 3: Managerial Round
In this round, I was asked one technical question, questions about my project, and a few HR questions. The question was related to an array. An array consisting of integer float and double numbers of length n is given. The interviewer instructed me to traverse the array in a specific order and square the numbers at specific indices. On the array, there were only a few conditions. I don't recall all of the conditions, but one of them was that the array should not contain any duplicate elements before and after the modification.  He asked how I should store the changes so that I can check that the conditions are still satisfied after the array is modified etc. He asked about boundary conditions, overflow, etc. Be confident and answer based on what you understand. The interviewer is chill and will help you with your doubts. Then he asked a few questions about my projects and areas of interest. Then he asked what I understood about the role, of EDG Intern and why Mathworks. Research about the company well. Finally, he asked about my preference of place. Be confident and answer fluently. Pause if you panic. The interviewer will help you throughout the interview.
 Round 4: HR Round

Be well prepared with your self-intro. Keep it short and interesting. Do not repeat stuff that is already on your resume. The questions in this round were all standard HR questions. Make sure that you understand what the role of an EDG intern is well. Research about the company. If you answer confidently when questions related to the company are asked, the interviewer will be very impressed. The questions asked in this round were:
1) What do you understand about the role you are applying for?
2)Why do you want to work at MathWorks?
3)How well do you work with a team?
4)How will you resolve a conflict? Give a real-life scenario where you had to resolve a conflict.
5)Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
and a few more similar questions. Do not bore the interviewer. Keep it interesting. Make sure that the interviewer has a good time interviewing us. Ask a few interesting questions to the interviewer towards the end when you get the chance. Do not stutter. If you feel tensed, pause for a few seconds and then continue. The interviewer is chill. Be confident and frank.

Tips
Research about the company
Make sure you understand the role that you are applying for
Be thorough with your resume
Watch sample GD videos and understand the parts and rules of a GD
Speak fluently and confidently
Be yourself
Make sure the interviewer does not get bored

AUTHOR : VENKATA AKHIL CHINTHALA
Stipend : 80,000 per month
Number of rounds: 3
Number of Test Round : 1
Number of Interview Rounds:  2
Round 1 : Online Test
Total of 4 coding questions
1. Given a string u need to perform any k swaps, find the lexicographically highest string possible
2. Given a 2d array of strings you need to return an array such that its columns length is the total no. of unique strings in (given 2d strings matrix) and the rows length should be the same as (2d matrix rows) and the value in each i,j should be either 0 or 1, if 1 that means that particular string is present in the given row of 2d matrix.
For example:
Given matrix  abc bca cbd
           abd bdf  cbd
           abd abc bca
We should return 
//abc abd bca bdf cbd
 1       0    1      0   1
 0       1    0      1   1
 1       1    1      0   0
3. Given an aeroplane which can carry passengers max total weight up to ‘w’ and array of passengers weight A[n] we need to find minimum trips in which all passengers can cross from initial mountain to their destination mountain (note: one passenger should fly the aeroplane)
4. (I don't remember the question)
Round 2: Technical Round (Total 2 people interviewed me)
They introduced themself and they asked me “tell me about yourself” (Try to keep it short and interesting, don't prolong this and be confident). I mentioned that I am good at DSA and OOPS.
They gave me a coding pad and a question and asked me to solve it. First I told my approach and then they asked me if I had solved this question earlier. I said yes and they were impressed for being genuine (the question was like: They will give a string something similar to like this Example: 1)  4(2())3()  we need to return 
(()())(()())(()())(()())()()()
        2)  3(2()2())
(()()()()())(()()()()())(()()()()())
Something similar to like this (basically we need to expand the given string)
They gave me two strings A, B and I had to find whether string A is the left or right of B (A similar question can be found on GFG)
They asked me OOPS concepts around 4-6 questions
They asked little about operating systems
And at last, they asked if I have any question for them (Try to always ask one). Total duration of the interview went for around 55 mins.
Round 3: Technical Round (Total 2 people interviewed me)
They introduced themself and they asked me to tell more about myself (be confident and energetic too)
They gave me a gaming scenario where millions of people will be playing a game and there will be a scoreboard. The question revolved around how I would maintain the scoreboard, update it and what is the time complexity along with the data structures to be used and how it would reduce the space complexity. A detailed discussion followed this question.
Then they gave me a coding question. Given a number you are allowed to swap any digits of the given number(any number of swaps). We should find the next greater number of the given number. For example : given 52134 my next greater element will be 52143 swapping the last two digits.
Next, they asked OOPS questions in depth and detailed.
And at last, they asked if I had any questions for them (Try to always ask one)
This round went for 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Tips:
Try to be interactive with the interviewer and always maintain a good conversation with them. 
If you have any small doubts try to ask them and feel free to ask your doubts.
If you don't know anything it's completely fine (don't get tensed) 
Even if you don't mention any project in your resume, it's okay. Be confident in the skills you mention in your resume. Having a project is definitely good as it can kill time in the interview. 
Make sure that whatever you have written in resume is done by you and don’t forge anything as this can put you in risk.
It's easy to code in C++, python (so try to be good at a programming language other than c)
Try to have a thorough practice on coding platforms like Interviewbit, hackerank, leetcode etc. Choose any one of them and practice.
That's all from my side. ALL THE BEST!

Number of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
The online test was conducted on hackerrank platform and consists of 17 questions(15 MCQ + 2 coding questions  ). Most of the MCQ questions are based on Networking ( HTTP error handling )and few on aptitude. The two coding questions are of medium level. 
 Expressive Words 
The second question is finding the digits in a jumbled string. 
Ex:  “eetnnni ” →   9 10
About 25 people are shortlisted for interviews. 
                              
 Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW(1 hour)
This round was a Technical round. This round was about 1 hour. I mentioned Networking during my introduction and the interviewer started asking questions related to networking. I managed to answer about 80% of the questions and he was quite impressed. After that, he asked about my favorite programming language and asked me to implement a space allocation for different data types in C. Later, he asked some simple questions about Binary-Tree and Linked-list. Most of this round is about networking. I also mentioned Operating System, this time only basics, since it was just the start of the semester. 
Round 3: SECOND INTERVIEW( 45 min)
Again this round was a Technical round with the manager. Again he started asking networking questions and he enquired whether it was part of academics or not. Since I learned on my own, he was again quite impressed with my answers. About 15 min later, he asked me to implement code for a coding question in C ( bit-manipulation ). After implementation, he helped me to shorten the code. Then he asked me for the logic for “kth node from the end of a linked-list ”and the process behind the compilation and execution of a C code. He asked me to allocate memory to a 2D array and asked me to do operations with it. At first, I told him that I don’t know, but later he encouraged me to try it. With that support, I completed the implementation and he was again impressed.  At last, he asked me, If big tech giants like Google and Facebook, will you leave Cisco? 
Round 4: HR Round (15 Min)
This round was completely HR. He asked some standard questions like tell me about yourself and what is success and why cisco. If we have to pick 1 person from 30 people, will you be there? and about location preference. This round is to test confidence and courage. Results were released later that night.
Tips:
Keep a coding daily, better to brush up on DSA in C .during the vacation
Before going to the interview, practice a mock interview with a friend.
Try to learn some concepts related to networking, by watching  some  youtube tutorials or reading articles 
Don’t bluff your resume, keep only the things that you are confident about.
It’s all about confidence, believing in yourself, and doing your best

AUTHOR : Ayush Peter Junior
Stipend: Rs. 76000
Number of rounds: 4
 Number of Test Rounds = 1 
 Number of Interview Rounds = 3
 Round 1 (Test): 
This was an Online Assessment conducted on HackerRank.
The duration was 60 minutes.
Topics included but weren’t limited to general aptitude, data structures, and basic networking.
Two coding problems – intermediate level
I solved the first one but couldn’t solve the second within the time limit of the test.
Around 20-25 people were selected in this round.
Round 2 (Interview): 
This was a technical interview.
I was asked questions from Data Structures and Networking:
Differences between Arrays and Linked Lists. Cases where one is preferred over the other.
Switches and Routers. How are their functions different?
I was then given one coding problem to solve while communicating my thought process. It was: ‘Given a string, check whether it is a valid IPv4 address. It was a relatively simple problem needing only a basic character by-character check. I did miss a few special cases but the interviewer guided me through fixing them.
Overall, the interviewer was satisfied with my performance.
Round 3 (Interview): 
This was a part technical – part HR interview.
The interviewer was friendly and amusing. This really lightened the mood and boosted my confidence.
I was asked about my interests and my expertise and what I knew about Cisco.
The interviewer then asked me about a project I recently worked on. This was the major part of the interview. I had to demonstrate my work and explain its work briefly.
He then showed me a couple of experimental features in Cisco’s WebEx platform they’ve been working on and the interview ended on a positive note.
Round 4 (Interview): 
This was a short HR round.
I was asked a couple of HR questions:
Why Cisco?
How do you define success?
The interviewer then asked me about my location preference and said he was generally impressed with my candidature. This was great news.
Throughout the rest of the day, I kept my hopes in check and when the results came in later, I was overjoyed to find my name.
Tips
Have a solid answer ready for the ‘Tell me about yourself question. It was the first question I was asked in every interview round. It’s also crucial in setting up a good first impression.
Be prepared for common HR round questions such as ‘why this company’, ‘why should we hire you, etc. You can find lots of resources online with tips and sample answers.
It is highly advised that you have at least one project to talk about as it was an essential part of one of my interview rounds. It needn’t be too complex but it shouldn’t be too simple. Make sure you know your project in and out and are comfortable presenting it.
When you add skills to your resume (be it soft or technical skills), be prepared for questions that ask you to recount situations where that skill was applied. This serves to prove the skills listed on your resume.
Practice doing coding problems regularly on platforms such as LeetCode, Codeforces, and HackerRank. Ensure that you have a good grasp of common data structures and algorithms. GeeksforGeeks is a great place to brush up on your DSA.
At the end of every interview, you are given a chance to ask the interviewer some questions. You must use this opportunity to ask a couple of questions you may have prepared beforehand as it suggests to the interviewer that you genuinely care about getting hired.
Others 
Interviews always seemed daunting to me and I had almost no experience. I had trouble eating/sleeping the night before my interview rounds. But I knew I had practiced enough and tried to keep calm. Even though I was restless before each interview round, once it started, I felt so much calmer and much more confident. Looking back, it all looks so simple.
Don’t be too hard on yourself if you don’t qualify for a round and don’t lose faith when your peers get selected and you don’t. Some may even get selected on their first try but what matters is you keep giving your best.
Avoid overworking. Plan your days ahead and take breaks regularly between practice sessions.
To all those who made it here, I wish you the very best. Hope you found some of these tips useful.

 Round 1: Test
 The initial set of questions included a bit of aptitude, networking concepts, computer organizations, and processor scheduling. Then there were two medium-level coding questions. Although the MCQs seemed difficult, I was able to get most of the test cases correct
        Round 2: Interview round 1
This was a technical interview round. They asked me to open a notepad and share my screen.  The questions they asked were
Sort an array containing just 0s, 1s, and 2s. I started with bubble sort, then with discussion, we arrived at counting sort (using hash maps) as the optimal solution. 
How much of the CPU will be used for a forever while loop? I didn't know the answer and I said so. The correct answer was 100%
A puzzle based on drawing colored balls from buckets. I was able to find the correct answer after the discussion.
Brief about my project  
Overall the interviewer was chill so there was a comfortable atmosphere.
        Round 2: Interview round 2
This was half technical, half HR round, with questions more related to computer organization, networking, and hardware. Same as before I had to share my screen. The questions were 
Coding question based on Bitwise & and shift operators. The interviewer helped me with this.
Explanation of four segments of the program 
Another common puzzle based on balls and buckets
Why choose CISCO over other companies?
        Round 3: Interview round 3
This was a complete HR round. Their questions included what my interests are. Why CISCO?  Are you okay with relocation? etc
Tips 
Concentrate on scheduling and backend-related coding. Try a few common interesting puzzles.
Be honest with what you know.  If you don't know the answer, be curious about it.

 Round 1 : 
It was an online test round conducted on HackerRank
It was divided into two parts
Basic Networking Questions
Two coding problems
I solved one of the coding questions and it was mainly implementation based. The networking questions were based on introductory networking concepts which are available on GeeksforGeeks.
Around 20-25 students were selected
Round 2 : 
It was a technical interview 
First, he asked questions about my projects.
The interviewer asked me whether I know any networking concepts. I was then asked questions on TCP/IP or OSI model, switches, routers, hub, and ARP protocol.
I was then asked about the pros and cons of linked lists and arrays
The major portion of 45 minutes was covered on these questions so finally, he asked me to write code for the most fundamental program reversing a linked list and dry run on some test cases
Round 3 : 
It was a technical/managerial round
I was asked to introduce myself
Then we discussed my projects - what was the inspiration for starting that project and the technical aspects.
He asked about some fundamental concepts of the C programming language like pointers and parameter passing mechanisms.
Then he asked me to write a code based on bit manipulation. He helped me a lot to convert my initial 15 lines of code into one-liner code.
I was then asked to program a code based on the linked list data type.
He then asked a puzzle-based question. He guided me a lot to arrive at the correct solution.
Finally, he asked ‘why Cisco’ and asked whether I had any questions.
Round 4 : 
It was a short HR round
I was asked to introduce myself
Then he asked what it success according to me
He then asked ‘why Cisco and NIT Calicut’
Finally, I was asked about location preferences.
Tips 
You have to think out loud, only then they will provide hints
Be calm (not 100% possible if you are giving the interview for the first time).
If you are aiming for Cisco you have to be strong in basic Networking concepts
Do some research on the company and its motto. It will be really helpful for questions like ‘why did you choose this company?’

Round 1: Online Test
This round was conducted on Hackerrank and consisted of 15 MCQs and 2 coding questions. The duration of the test was 1 hour. The MCQs were mostly aptitude based with some basic networking. The coding questions were basically 
From a jumbled string of numbers, names extract numbers in ascending order. eg. iFEnVnIETsoErHeEOnFTeeNUTIRiwhVosxeg outputs 123456789
Another easier string manipulation question that I couldn’t complete in time. Basically to check if a string can be made by expanding another string based on a set of rules.
 
Round 2: Interview Round 1 - Technical
This was a technical round. All the Cisco interviewers were quite chill and made us feel comfortable before moving on to the questions. After the small talk, he asked me to open a notepad and share my screen. 
The first question was to sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s. I told the simple counting solution but then he asked to do it in place and with a lot of help from his side, we worked on a solution.
Then he asked me for a couple of puzzles which we worked through (again, he was very helpful). The focus was more on working through the problems than reaching the solution. In the end, the interviewer asked if I had any questions and the round ended on a positive note. The round lasted 45 mins.
Round 3: Interview Round 2 - Technical
The interviewer for this round was even more chill than the previous one.
He started with some C-related theory questions from topics like storage classes, memory management, etc. Some questions were trick questions and he helped me see through them. 
Then he asked me to share my screen and we worked through a couple of coding questions. The first was an easy bit manipulation question and the second was to find the nth node from the end of a linked list. Again he appeared to be more interested in listening to my thought process and working to a solution than watching me solve it.
Next, he asked for a couple of puzzles again. The puzzles were really fun to work through.
Lastly, he asked about my project and I told the story of how it was conceived and what it does. This round also ended with a question to the interviewer and also lasted 45 mins.
Round 4: Interview Round 3 - HR
This round was all personal questions and questions about cisco. He asked basic HR questions like why Cisco and what I know about Cisco and my experience with Cisco products (we have Webex :p). I quoted from their PPT for a lot of Cisco-related questions. 
He also asked about my future plans like M.Tech. MBA etc. to which I gave a vague reply. He asked for my preferred location (Bangalore/Chennai/Pune). This round only lasted 15 minutes and also ended with a question to the interviewer.
Tips
Never stop talking. Think out loud about all questions and they will help you reach the solution.
It does help to know basic networking and OS concepts but if they ask you can say you just know the basics but do have the course this year. 
Read through Interview Diaries and GFG archives for the company and prepare well. 
Practicing coding and puzzle questions might help.
Paying attention to the PPT helps in the HR round.
Also, prepare to talk about yourself well.
Ask about the work culture at cisco at the end of interviews, they love talking about that. ;)
Be pleasant and try to match the interviewer’s vibe. ;)

Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
The online test was about an hour and a half. There were a few aptitude based questions, some networking questions, and ended with 2 coding problems. Compared to some of the previous online tests like Goldman Sachs, this was not as hard. Go through the basics of networking to prepare for this. The coding part was like any other entrance test, somewhere in between easy and intermediate.   
 Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW
This round was completely technical. It was a one on one interview. The interviewer was not intimidating and it helped reduce stress a lot. He asked what coding languages I was familiar with-I said C and python. He asked me to open notepad and share screen. He started off easy; the first question was based on data types and the space allocated per data type. It was a struct with unsigned int, double, etc. Then he moved on to a coding question based on adjacency matrix, was not very hard. He gave enough time to type out the solution. Then he moved on to networking. I told him that I only know the basics of it. He asked a few questions about TCP/IP protocols. I answered 75% of the networking questions. 
Then he moved on to OS based questions, again only the basics. Stuff like difference between Linux and Windows OS. Then he asked me about coding languages, compilers, differences between languages, etc.
Round 3: SECOND INTERVIEW
This round was mostly technical with a bit of HR towards the end, again one on one. It started off with him asking me about the projects on my resume. This is an important aspect of the interview. The project needs to be moderately complex, but at a level where you can explain it without hesitation. He then proceeded to ask me what my favorite topic was. I said DSA. He then gave me a few advanced data structures to choose from. I chose AVL Tree. It is important to know and specialize in a few advanced structures. I had done AVL and Red-Black trees well, luckily one of the options he gave was AVL. I explained all the rotations and the different scenarios, and time complexities. The HR questions were based on the soft skills that I had mentioned in my resume. He asked me where I acquired those skills, and how I would be able to implement them during my internship. 
Round 4: FINAL INTERVIEW
This round was almost totally HR, a final wrap-up. He asked me why I would want to join CISCO, why I chose NIT Calicut, why I chose Computer Science. He asked me what the biggest hardship I had ever faced was. He asked if I would be relocating for the internship. It was quite chill overall, just needed to be enterprising and confident. That marked the end of the process. The results were announced later that night.
Tips:
Keep coding throughout the vacation, one or two problems a day from hackerrank or leetcode.
Ensure that you have 2 solid projects to talk about
Prepare the basics of DBMS, OS and networking 
Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it.
Don’t lose hope when you get rejected. Keep going. I got rejected by DE Shaw in the interview process. It is important to brush it off and prepare harder.
Think about a few simple HR questions beforehand, some points about yourself, so that HR goes well
Look up the interview questions by GFG for each company beforehand.
Others: The internship drive is a stressful time, I lost a couple of nights of sleep stressing about it, so be ready for it. Spend a few hours preparing as soon as the vacation starts, no need for anything extreme. Do not get disheartened when you see your friends get through, just keep faith. All the best to whoever reads this, I hope the tips and advice above helps make your process a little less stressful than mine was.

AUTHOR : Gurrala Venkata Sai Chetan Teja
STIPEND: 76,000 per month
Number of rounds: 4
Number of Test Rounds = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1: ONLINE TEST
The test was conducted on the Hackerrank portal with proctoring consisting of 17 questions(15 MCQs + 2 coding questions).
Most MCQs were covering topics from networking, and aptitude was mostly doable.
Coming to the coding questions, they were easy to intermediate. Time was the thing that mattered most as we had a total of 1 hr only and both the coding questions were implementation-type questions, hence time taking.
.
Question 1: Had the main string and some other strings, we had to say if it is possible to convert these other strings into the main string with some conditions such as the characters could be doubled or tripled but not reduced, also that the final count of a changed character should be greater than or equal to 3.
The 1st question was about complete implementation without any logic. I just had to figure out the most efficient method and it took time as it was pretty lengthy.
The 2nd question was a logical one where we had to find the actual number where we would be given the spelled out number but the characters were completely jumbled.
I had completely done the 1st question and 2nd question partially and attempted all the MCQs.
Around 25 students were shortlisted from here.
Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW
This round was technical but was not coding for me. 
Starting with telling me about yourself, I tried mentioning the topics I was more comfortable in specifically so that the interviewer would ask me to focus on those, luckily it worked and she started asking if I knew oops concepts well. She started asking what is it that comes to your mind once you think of oops, and continued with more theoretical questions focussing on inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, and some more of these concepts in depth. 
Then asking briefly about the ML project I had done, she tried asking questions about the basics of python like the difference between list and tuple, and how to convert one from another.
After answering pretty much everything she had asked since I was also in my comfort zone, she was impressed and told us we could wind up the session in just around 25 mins and told me to prepare for the next round.
ROUND 3: SECOND INTERVIEW:
A more experienced person was the interviewer this time and this round was more of a discussion and learning. He didn't try to see what I knew but tried seeing how interested I am in learning new things.
Starting with the same question to introduce myself, he started questioning about the ML project. Explaining machine learning to a person who doesn't have any idea about it was his first question, hence I explained by mentioning all the types and took an example of a situation explained, then mentioned what I had done in my project. He was interested and asked me if we were to build a robot that played basketball with you. What would you start with? He tried this question trying to find how I would approach a problem.
This discussion went for around 25 mins.
Then he asked what field I would like to work in if I would join cisco.
I answered by saying I would like to explore Networking because it was mainly a networking company. 
This part kind of backfired as he started asking me about networking now, though I said I wasn’t strong in it. Well, it turned out fine finally as he wanted to observe how I was interested in learning, he also started speaking more about networking and discussed more everyday applications of networking.
This discussion also went on for about 30 mins.
So this round was kind of both hr and technical, I wasn't sure if he had liked my performance as it was not purely technical. It was a long round of about 80 mins.
After an hour or so they called for the HR round. 
ROUND 4: HR INTERVIEW
This was more of a formality round. 
Questions were more predictable like what is success according to you, what was your most challenging situation, and also location preference.
Be prepared before the interview as most of them are answerable. Also do a little research on the company before the start of interviews, which would definitely be helpful.
7 Students had been selected finally after 4 rounds.
Tips
Greeting them with a positive voice felt a little boost at the start of the interview, it felt more interactive
The main goal is to understand what the interviewer expects from us and try to present it in that way so that it would be more interesting rather than just a formality.
Practicing starting at least 1 month before the start of interviews is preferred.
Mainly on leetcode and interview bit as they have pretty standard questions and are similar to problems in coding tests.
Others 
Do not get depressed about not getting selected or dropping out in interviews, it is not a matter of only hard work and skill but also a lot of luck. So keep trying without losing your focus, or it could be really stressful

Total Number of Rounds: 4
Number of test rounds: 1
Number of interview rounds: 3 (2 Technical + 1 HR)
Round 1 (Online Coding Round):
This round consisted of two coding questions to be solved within 45 minutes. Each student had a different set of two questions. One of my questions was to print the kth smallest element in an array. I do not remember the other one, but it was a relatively easier question. The general opinion was that the test was easy when compared to all the other tests we had written before. 
There were many students who had solved both the questions and passed all the given test cases. However, only around 20 students were shortlisted for the next round. So it is essential to make sure you submit the most optimized code as your answer.
Round 2:
This round was a technical round that went on for exactly 30 minutes. The interviewer was enthusiastic and allowed me to make myself comfortable by asking a few general questions about myself before starting with the technical side of the interview. She had started the technical side of this round by asking me if I was aware of OOPS concepts and later asked a few questions on OOPS such as the different access specifiers, and the difference between private and public inheritance. She then went on to ask how the concept of private and public classes had been achieved in an example she had given to me.
This was followed by a coding question where I had to code the Fibonacci series. I first gave the recursive approach and was asked its time complexity. The interviewer later asked for a more optimized approach, for which I gave an iterative approach.
12 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3:
This round was also a technical round and was scheduled for 45 minutes. Like the first technical round, this round also began with a set of introductory questions about myself which made me a bit more comfortable with the interviewer. He started the technical side of the interview by asking about binary trees. He then asked me to write a code for the minimum height of a binary tree given n nodes. This was followed by a few questions on OOPS, computer fundamentals, and SQL. He asked if I had any knowledge about operating systems to which I explained the OS lab project I was working on. The round ended with the interviewer asking me if I had any questions for him.
8 students were shortlisted for the final round.
Round 4 (HR Round):
This was a very short round of about 5 minutes only where the interviewer asked me to tell her why I wanted to work at SAP.
All 8 students who made it to the HR round were selected for the internship.
Tips:
Be thorough with OOPS and DSA concepts.
Go through company-wise practice questions given on Geeks for Geeks.
Always try to give the most optimal solution to a problem. You may have multiple methods of solving the problem when asked a coding question in an interview. Start by giving the method with the worst time complexity. Later you can improve your solution by giving algorithms with better time complexities, each time clearly explaining your thought process.
Try to make the most use of the 2 months break you get after your second year by practicing coding on online platforms such as Leetcode and HackerRank.
Be extremely thorough with whatever you have put on your resume.

Number of rounds: 4
Number of Test Rounds = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 3
Round  1: Online Coding Test 
This round had 2 coding questions, and both of them were easy. It was important to optimize the solution. You should practice easy and medium
level questions from geeksforgeeks or from platforms such as leetcode, hackerrank.
21 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2: Interview
It was a 20-minute round. At first, I was asked to give my introduction. The interviewer then asked me about procedural programming. I was then asked some basic questions on object-oriented programming. The interviewer asked me how to solve a particular problem in an object-oriented way and then he asked me to tell the benefits of using an object-oriented methodology. He asked me some fundamental questions, to give real-world examples of stack and queue. I was asked a basic question about database schema as well. He then asked me about the projects which I have done. 
In the end, he asked if I knew about machine learning and artificial intelligence. I didn’t have much knowledge about these areas so I told him that, to which he replied that it is fine. Finally, he asked me that for a problem if I can only optimize only one out of space complexity or time complexity, which one should I optimize, to which I replied that it depends on the system requirement, in this case where we have to choose only one out of both, if we are given enough time, but less space we will optimize space complexity and if we are given enough space but limited time, then we will optimize time complexity.
Around 12-13 students qualified for the next round.
Round 3: Interview
It was a 45-minute round. I was first asked to introduce myself and he then asked me about the subjects I have studied up to now in my BTech. Then he asked some general questions regarding the subjects which I mentioned. I was then asked my preferred programming language, to which I replied C and C++. So again we had some discussion about the differences between C and C++. He then asked me the explanation of a coding question which was to convert a string to a number. I was asked to describe each and every step in detail. He asked me how to convert a character to an integer. I answered that we would have to subtract ‘0’ from that character, and he asked me the logic behind it, which was related to the ASCII value of 0. I was asked one more coding question which was - what is a palindrome and how to check if a given string is a palindrome or not? He then asked me about the precedence order of various operators. He then asked which has higher precedence * or /. I replied that both had the same precedence, so he asked me whether they are left-associative or right-associative. He then asked me if ‘=’ is right-associative or left-associative if we write a = b = c. I was also asked to tell various sorting algorithms and he asked me to tell the time complexity of those algorithms.
He asked me some questions about maps, strings, pairs, etc in C++.
8 students were selected for the next round.
Round 4: HR round
This was a short round of about 10 minutes. HR asked me to introduce myself and to tell about my achievements and about my academics. Then she asked me if I had any other offers. Then in the end she asked me if I had any questions. 
8 students were selected for the role.
Tips
You should know each and everything which you have mentioned in your resume. Avoid adding things to your resume which you don’t know.
If you haven’t done any big projects then try to do at least some mini projects.
Practice a lot of coding questions from coding platforms like geeksforgeeks.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, it is ok to tell the interviewer that you are not sure about the answer.
Others: Utilize your summer vacations properly to improve your coding skills, you should have good knowledge about the concepts of DSA.

Number of Rounds: 4
Number of test rounds: 1
Number of interview rounds: 3 (2 Technical + 1 HR)

Round 1: Online Test
It consisted of two array questions to solve in 45 minutes. They were at the easy to medium level. Solving questions in leetcode or geeksforgeeks or a similar website should prepare you enough.
Around 20 students were shortlisted for Interviews.
Round 2: Technical Interview 1
This round was pretty short. The interviewer first asked a couple of programming-related questions about code valid parentheses, some theories on inheritance in C++, and the diamond problem of inheritance. Then moved on to 2-3 puzzles.
Around 12 people were shortlisted for the next round.

Round 3: Technical Interview 2
This round was a little more challenging. It started with a basic linked list question. And once I arrived at a solution, the interviewer would modify the question by either limiting things I can use or adding extra parts/constraints such that my method wouldn’t work and I would have to think of a new one. He did this around 4-5 times. He then went on to ask theory questions. I was asked to talk about sets, lists, and maps. He then asked to talk more about hash maps, explain the different hashing methods we’ve learned, what hash functions are, etc. He also asked a few random questions, explaining Digital Image Processing, Salt and Pepper noise, and some questions about Computer Organization and C++.
8 people were shortlisted for the HR round.
Round 4: HR Round
The interviewer asked me to talk about myself and asked why I wanted to join SAP and a couple of other questions. I was also given a chance to ask a question of my own, and I asked one I had prepared.

All 8 shortlisted candidates were offered the internship.
Tips:
Be thorough with OOPS concepts and the basic theory of various DSA topics like Sets, Maps, etc.
Practice a lot of puzzles, you can find them in Geeksforgeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzles/
If you haven’t done much coding through your second year, use your summer vacation wisely. Practice a lot of coding in those months.
If you have any other project or internship stated in your resume, be thorough with what you have done, as they can ask many questions based on that as well.
Don’t hesitate to ask your seniors for help when you need any.

Number of Test Rounds = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 3
Round  1: Online Coding Test 
This round was an online coding test with 2 coding questions. They were easy to medium-level questions but I think it was important to try and get the most time-efficient solution even if it passes all the test cases. 
The first question was to find the kth largest element in an unsorted array https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kth-smallestlargest-element-unsorted-array
Go through leetcode (easy and medium) and geeksforgeeks to practice these types of problems.
21 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2: Interview
It started with an introduction and a basic overview of my projects. The interviewer made me feel comfortable as I was quite nervous at the time. Then she asked me a few questions related to OOPs concepts. The questions were: 
What are the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming?
What are inheritance and composition? 
Difference between encapsulation and abstraction.
Give an example of inheritance in real life.
Give an example of how you have used the concepts of OOPS in any of your projects. For this, there wasn’t an exact answer. She was trying to see how I would think of linking my project to OOPs concepts.
Then she asked me if I knew about scheduling, to which I replied that I am taking OS in the coming semester so I didn't know.
After this, I was given a coding question to solve which was to find all the permutations of a given string. Luckily I had done this question before so I was able to answer it. I was not asked to run test cases as they were mainly checking the logic, not the exact syntax.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string
Then I was asked to find the time complexity of my solution. This solution assumes that all the characters were unique or else repeated elements would be printed. I was asked to modify my program assuming that the characters were not unique. I struggled a bit on this to find an efficient solution but the interviewer pointed me in the right direction when I was stuck and I was able to solve that.
Around 13 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3: Interview
Again, it started with an introduction where I briefly explained my projects. Then, the interviewer moved on to OOPs concepts again. Here I was asked to explain how I would create an object-oriented design for a car. There is no single correct answer to this question, but he was satisfied with my answer. He asked me a few more related questions before moving on to a coding question.
It was to merge two sorted linked lists. Again I wasn’t required to have
perfect syntax but I had to have the correct logic and be able to explain my code and approach. I used an iterative solution for this but I had made a mistake in my initial condition. After explaining my approach and the time complexity, he asked me to take a test case and explain what would happen at each step. At this point, I realized my mistake and quickly told him what the mistake was and how to fix it. He was satisfied with this answer and asked me to solve a basic puzzle after this. It was very similar to the following puzzle. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-growing-water-lilly
8 students were shortlisted for the final round.
Round 4: Interview
This round was mainly an HR round. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and talk about why I wanted to join SAP. Then I was asked about my overall experience in studying at NITC. I was asked if I had any questions about SAP and I asked a question I had prepared earlier. After this, the interview process was over.
8 students were selected for the role.
Tips
Think before answering each question, even if you think you may know the answer. 
If you don’t know that particular topic or question, it’s okay to tell the interviewer. 
Practice leetcode questions or questions from other platforms. Some solutions may be difficult to come up with during the interview if you haven’t solved a similar problem before.
Make sure that you can find out the complexity of the solutions that you give.
Make sure you know everything that you have added to your resume. Have some projects to show that you can apply the concepts you have learned.
Others: Please do not waste your summer vacation. I had started very late and nearly missed out on such a great opportunity. Make sure to use this time to learn DSA properly and practice problems. During this time, it is going to be quite stressful and it’s important to take the help of your seniors and friends as they will help you to keep moving forward.

No. of Rounds: 1 Coding test, 1 Recorded video interview, 1 Hackathon
Round 1(Coding test):
The test was on HackerRank consisting of 2 coding questions. The difficulty level of the questions was easy.
Given an array of strings containing names of tools(can have duplicates), Starting index and target tool. Find the minimum number of steps to reach the target tool from the starting index. The array is circular and you can move left or right.
Eg. Tools = [‘saw’, ‘hammer’, ‘ladder’, ‘saw’, ‘scissors’, ‘mallet’, ‘screw’ ]
Starting index: 2
Target Tool: saw
Output: 1
Given a binary linked list, print its decimal equivalent.
Tips: Practice easy and medium questions from HackerRank, GeeksforGeeks and LeetCode.
Round 2(Video Interview):
The interview was held on the Hirevue platform. It had 2 behavioral questions. It was a recorded video interview. You have 2 attempts to record the interview and once you go for the second attempt the first attempt gets deleted.
The questions were like
Describe a situation in which you learnt something important from a mistake in any school or college project.
Describe a situation when you did something more than expected in a project and was appreciated for that.
Tips: Practice the sample questions on Hirevue and familiarize yourself with the platform.
Round 3(Code for Good Hackathon):
It is a 24 hour hackathon where you develop innovative technological solutions to non profit organizations. You are divided into groups of 6-7 members randomly based on your skills. There were about 650 participants and 100 teams. There were 9-10 NGOs and the problem statements were given by each of the NGOs. Each team has to provide their preferences in the problem statements. The final allotment of the problem statement is done on a first come first served basis. A problem statement will be allotted to about 9-10 teams.
Each team is given 2 mentors who assist you for the whole hackathon and monitor each candidate. Subject matter experts were also there who helped in solving technical problems during the hackathon.
At the end of the hackathon you have to provide a PPT and video describing your solution and its functionalities. After that there is a technical judging round where you need to explain your project in front of NGO representatives and JPMC officials. 2 teams from each problem statement are selected and they have to undergo a second judging round. After that a winner is declared for each problem statement.
My team consisted of 6 members, all of them from different colleges. The problem statement that we got was to develop a platform for volunteer community engagement for the Youngistaan Foundation(NGO). We developed a web application and the tech stacks that we used were Node.js, MongoDB, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
During the hackathon 2 interviews were conducted for each of the members.
The question that they asked me were:
What is your contribution to the project?
How is the experience with your team?
Did you do any project outside the curriculum? If so, describe them?
If selected, which field do you wish to work in?
What is REST API?
What is a Domain Name System(DNS)?
What is Inheritance? (Since I knew C++) 
Give an example of class and objects from the things in your room.
What is function overloading and function overriding?
Our team was selected as one of the finalists but didn't win. You need not win the hackathon to be selected for the internship.
Tips: Familiarize yourself with tech stacks used for development.
Take leadership and hear out the opinions of your team members.

Number of rounds: 3
A preliminary coding round followed by a recorded interview and the Code for Good Hackathon.The Code For Good event is the only way by which the students can apply for the Software Engineer Program (SEP) at JP Morgan Chase & Co.
Round 1 : Coding Round-Online test
    This was conducted in the month of February in our fourth semester and was the first company to come for the internship drive in our campus.It consisted of two easy level coding questions and was held in the Hackerrank platform.The questions were :
Given an Array of String containing names of Tools (can have duplicates), the Starting index and A Target Tool, find the Minimum Number of Steps required to reach the target tool from the starting index. The Array is Circular, that is, If you reach the End of the array, you can go to its start and vice versa.
Given a Linked List having either 0 or 1 as its elements, find the decimal representation of the binary number formed by the nodes of the list. 
Try to complete both the questions with the maximum number of positive test cases. 
 2-Recorded Interview: 
This was a recorded video interview round conducted on HireVue platform.You will be given two situation based questions and are expected to come up with answers.There will also be a trial session along with two attempts to answer. Not much preparation is required for this round, be confident and answer to the point. 
Shortlisting will be done based on our performance in online tests and video interviews. 
Round 3 (Code for Good Hackathon): 
    The event was conducted from July 8 to July 11,in which the first two days consisted of just preparatory sessions and the hackathon was on the third day.Almost 650 students from different colleges across India were selected for the hackathon. You will be divided into a team of 5-6 members and there are a total of 100 teams. The hackathon basically has several NGOs participating in it and our task was to come up with a solution for the problem statement of the respective NGO. Make sure you learn something related to development before hand.My team came up with a web app where I contributed towards the back end of the application which was done using django(python). You will be assigned two mentors from the JPMC team.There will be a one on one session with the mentor which sometimes would be like an interview. My session was almost informal, asking about my contribution to the project we made, the possibilities to which it could be extended and some questions regarding my experiences and skills, both technical and non-technical.
The next day, one of the team members has to present the solution before the judging panel. 
Though we could not make it to the finals, it was one of the best experiences. Working with a team of people whom you had met for the first time was also a nice experience.Your internship opportunity does not depend on whether you win/lose the hackathon. 
Tips 
Practice coding questions available on leetcode, hackerrank,codechef and geeksforgeeks. 
Take initiative and leadership roles while participating in the hackathon.Try to put forward all your thoughts and suggestions during the discussion as well as throughout the event. Resources

AUTHOR : RAHUL KUMAR MAURYA
Stipend:  Rs. 50000/month
No. of Rounds: 3 
The company visited our campus in late January 2021 and the whole process took time till July.
There were 2 coding questions based on basic data structures and algorithms. I don’t remember any questions exactly but the difficulty level was medium and a person who had solved questions on various coding platforms,  can easily crack it.
Test duration was 1 hour.
In this round there were two pre recorded HR type questions for which we had to record our answer with a video. We all had two attempts for each question. This round was conducted on the HireVue platform. For me the questions were related to the projects that I had done in college, difficulties faced and how I reacted in that situation.
Through other sources I came to know that shortlisting for the 3rd round is based on the cumulative performance in 1st and 2nd round together.
In March, results were announced for the 3rd round. About 20 students from our college were selected along with me.
It happened in July after postponing many times. In this round we had to innovate a software solution for the problem of one NGO. Everyone will get a random team of 5-6 members  with a uniform distribution of people with different skill sets. It is highly unlikely that someone will get a team member from the same college. Before the hackathon there were several workshops conducted by JP Morgan Chase & Co so that we can have enough things to perform well in the hackathon. The Hackathon started on 10 July 10:00 AM. It is for 24 hrs duration. Every team got 2 Mentors who will be helping throughout the hackathon and also judging the performance of every member. The selection criteria of JP Morgan Chase & Co. is unpredictable. We were told that it doesn’t matter whether you are good at development or whether you know various tech stacks or not, they were looking at how you perform in a team, how you collaborate  according to your limited skill set and I felt that they were also looking for good communication skills.
For me I had some hands-on experience on frontend. I had spent a lot of time in competitive coding. My mentor knew this so he was looking at how I could help my team to achieve the given task.
I used to help my team members in researching out some required materials and handled parts of the frontend in the project. From 8:00 PM onwards the mentor started to call every team member  one by one in a separate call for Interview. I went there and had a healthy discussion with my mentor for about 10-12 minutes. He asked me how I would demonstrate  my product which we were currently making. He also asked about my contribution to the project. I explained all the things from research to  coding the front end things. He also does some cross questions on looking at code. I answered all his questions effectively. He was quite satisfied with all my answers and was impressed with the confidence and clear cut message transfer.
I worked on project till 4:00AM along with my teammates and went for a nap and woke up at about 7:00 AM, because 10:00 AM was the deadline for submission of the solution.
In the Judging round we were not able to qualify for the finals but judges were quite impressed with our unique idea behind the solution.
After the judging round, another mentor called us one by one and asked about our experience and gave us some feedback.
For me he said never underestimate yourself in any situation and he was quite happy with my contribution.
Have some experience with development beforehand.
Try some competitive coding platform to train your mind to think analytically.
Develop effective communication skills to pass on clear cut messages.

SOFTWARE ENGINEER PROGRAM INTERN
AUTHOR : MEENAKSHI S
Stipend: Rs 50,000/- per month
Number of rounds: 3
A coding round followed by a recorded video interview. This was followed by the ‘Code for Good’ hackathon organized by JP Morgan Chase & Co.
Round 1 : Coding Round
 The coding round was the first step in the whole recruitment process. It was held on the HackerRank platform around the last week of February, 2021. It consisted of 2 questions, with difficulty level tending towards the easier side.
The first question was, given a circular array of words, find the smallest number of steps to move from a given source index to the target word. The moves could be made in the left or right direction.
The second question required you to find the decimal equivalent of a given binary list.
Round 2 : This round required the candidates to give a recorded video interview. It was held via the HireVue Platform. You will have the opportunity to try out practice questions. HireVue will then present you with two questions, for which you have to record responses via videos. 
The questions were not technical, but more situational in nature. One of the questions was to describe a time when I took initiative during a group project and the second one was to state a lesson I learnt from a mistake I made.
The coding round and video interview formed the basis of shortlisting participants to the next round.
Round 3 (Code for Good Hackathon): 
 The shortlisted participants were randomly grouped into teams of 6-7 members to participate in the Code for Good (CFG) Hackathon. The 24 hour hackathon witnessed around 600+ participants grouped into around 100 teams competing against each other.During the hackathon, you'll collaborate with other coders to develop innovative technology solutions for not-for-profit organizations. This year’s CFG had around 10-11 NGOs seeking technological solutions to real life issues faced by them.
 My group consisted of  6 members from different colleges. We were allotted the problem statement hosted by the Youngistaan Organization. We planned on coming up with a web app as a solution to the issues faced by the organization. The coding session was followed by two rounds of video presentation. Unfortunately, our team didn’t make it to the finals
Each team is assigned  two JPMC officials as mentors. They assess you on various aspects, ranging from technical skills to how important your contribution is to the team and how well you work in an unfamiliar environment. There could even be one on one interviews with the mentors.
 Winning the hackathon doesn’t guarantee an internship. The point was to put in the best of your efforts.
Tips 
Practice coding questions available on coding platforms like leetcode, hackerrank and geeksforgeeks
During the hackathon and interviews, do not shy away from asking questions and clearing doubts
It is always advantageous to familiarize yourself with a tech stack.

 SERVER TECHNOLOGY FULL-TIME
AUTHOR : DEV SONY
CTC - 31.95LPA
Round 1 - Technical Test
Unlike the usual technical tests, no programming questions were asked. It focused more on questions about general programming, OOP, aptitude and logical reasoning. There were 4 sections, although I don’t recall how they were categorized. That won’t be important as sections would be sequential with designated timings.
After this, 43 of us were shortlisted and 18 were kept on the waiting list for Server Technology.
Round 2- Technical Interview 1
The first interview is going to be a crucial one, as it determines what topics you would be asked in the later rounds. Since this is for the Server Technology division, they will be primarily interested in your Networking, DBMS and Linux Administration skills. What I had observed is that, if you hadn’t mentioned any of these interests, the next rounds would be revolving around DBMS topics. Be confident in the interview, as there is a strong chance that the future interviewers will be watching your one-on-one with the current interviewer to determine which topic fits you. In my case, I had shown an interest in Linux Administration.
As for questions, they asked simple DSA problems. The first question was to sort two sorted arrays (A and B) without creating a new array or modifying their sizes. To give more clarity, here’s an example- 
A = [1, 5, 9, 10, 15, 20]   ---->   A = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9]
B = [2, 3, 8, 13]       B = [10, 13, 15, 20]
After this, I was asked to optimize the code. You can code in any programming language as long as it makes sense to the interviewer.
The second question was to reverse a Linked List, and later how to optimize it. 
Side Note:  If you’re selected to the next round, you’ll be transferred to a breakout room. Otherwise, bye bye!
Round 3 - Technical Interview 2
The interviewer first asked which scripting language I was comfortable with, and I went ahead with python. He then asked me to check whether an inputted string was a palindrome or not and how many characters had to be adjusted to make it one. For the latter part, he was satisfied with my explanation and didn’t ask me to program it.
Remember how I mentioned that the future rounds would be about one of the 3 topics? Yeah, the next few questions were all about Linux. He started off with simple ones such as how to ping servers and test latency, and then proceeded to ask how to kill processes, run processes in the background, find their PIDs and so on. One of the final questions he asked was how I could debug a program. Even though I had suggested running it through the terminal, he wanted a more detailed debug report using just UNIX instead of GNU commands. (I should’ve looked this up in the breakout room before the next interview) 
He ended the interview by asking how comfortable I was with using Linux on a scale of 1 to 5. Clearly, my next interviewer noted this down.
Round 4- Technical Interview 3
Now that they’re pretty thorough on which topic you’ll be comfortable with, you would be facing experienced professionals who’ve been on the field for a long time. My interviewer had been using SOLARIS and other UNIX based Operating Systems for 17+ years, so the questions he asked were quite hard. He first asked how I could debug a program using just UNIX commands. (The answer is using strace() for those wondering. As I mentioned earlier, I should’ve looked it up.) He then asked me questions on how I could figure out errors that occur while connecting to remote systems and how I could resolve them. Essentially, I was being stress tested on the rating I gave in my previous interview.
The interview ended with me enquiring about the day-to-day responsibilities, work-life balance and his experience with the company. It's always good to end all your interviews with questions like these.
That’s about it. No managerial rounds were taken and the results were released on the same day. Out of 43, 12 of us were selected for the role.

 Number of Interview Rounds = 2
 Round 1 : 
It was a proctored online test on Oracle’s platform with five parts spanning Language, Aptitude, Database Knowledge, C/Java Knowledge and DSA. Each part has a fixed timer. Each of these parts has sub-parts. I remember being stuck in an Aptitude subpart and losing time to complete the last subpart of that section.
The language section is all about reading the passage and answering questions. A little reading practice would help. Aptitude was time-consuming but straightforward. Some Database questions were with the ER diagrams. C/Java questions were mainly of advanced pointers. DSA had some AVL and Red-Black tree questions
The exam I remember was not so difficult. Do not stick to a specific question if you aren’t getting the answer in two-three attempts. And since there wasn’t negative marking, I guessed the ones I didn’t know. Make sure you are thorough with DBMS and SQL basics. Refreshing knowledge of pointers and double pointers would help. I wasn’t too strong in sorting and tree questions, so I skipped/guessed most of those problems. I did the Hashing ones right as I was confident in that.

 39 candidates were shortlisted for Server Tech. and 44 candidates were shortlisted for Apps.
          Round 2 : 
Morning 11 AM. Coding round with two questions. It took a total time of 1 hour. The interviewer was a nice person, and she gave me a lot of time to think about my logic while coding. It was a Zoom one-on-one meeting where you had to share your screen with the notepad and type the C/Java code (pseudocode is acceptable). 
First off, she asked if I had done anything apart from my resume projects (which were elementary Python programs only). I said no. And then, she asked if I were comfortable in programming languages apart from Python. I told her I knew C and C++.
The first question she asked was to write the code to convert a string into a number (Eg: “-163.25” into the float value -163.25) without using any inbuilt libraries. Here’s the exact question:
Implement code to calculate the value of the string “-123456.89”. Do not use or assume the availability of parsing libraries.
The second program in this link is similar to the given problem, though without the decimal point constraint. Need to make a variable to store the sign of the number. -1 or 1 depending on if there is a ‘-’ at the start of the string. Then search the string for the decimal point’s index. Then move indices leftwards and multiply them with the increasing power of 10 starting from 1 till the left end of the string, adding these products to an answer variable. (3*1 + 6*10 + 1*100 = 163). Then go back to the decimal point index and traverse indices rightwards till the right end of the string and keep multiplying it with a decreasing power of 10 starting from 0.1 while adding these products to the answer variable (163 + 2*0.1 + 5*0.01 = 163.25). Finally, multiply the answer variable with the sign to get the final answer.
I always had a similar line of thought while solving the problem, except for the part of the powers. The interviewer reminded me that I couldn’t use any pow function in the code. Be as communicative as possible to the interviewer, explaining each line of code that you write, preferably with an example. Even if it is wrong, they might give hints to help you out. The interviewer was satisfied with the code, and we moved to the next question.
The second question was to find the shortest subsequence in an array whose sum was the given number. The interviewer explained the question to me in this manner:
Q: Maximum length of the subarray with the sum 
Given A[] = {5, 6, -5, 5, 3, 5, 3, -2, 0} and Sum = 8
Subarrays with sum 8 are
{-5, 5, 3, 5}
{3, 5}
{5, 3}
The longest subarray is {-5, 5, 3, 5} having length 4
Similar to this one. The link gives a priority queue solution. However, I used Dynamic Programming (time complexity O(n*n)) by creating a new empty array and storing the cumulative sum of the previous values. For example, in the question corresponding to array A, the new array B gets values 
{5, 11, 6, 11, 14, 19, 22, 20, 20}.
Append a 0 at the start of array B for a specific corner case. (If the given Sum was 5, then we should get the first index as a possible answer)
Now B[] = {0, 5, 11, 6, 11, 14, 19, 22, 20, 20}
Initialise a variable max_length = 0. We take two pointer variables i=0 and j=i+1, to traverse the array using a nested for loop. Increment j by 1 in the inner loop and increment i by 1 in the outer loop. For i=0, j ranges from 1,2,...,n. For i=1, j ranges from 2,3,...,n and so on. In each iteration check the value of B[j] - B[i]. If it’s equal to the value of the required sum and greater than the current value of max_length, save the value of (j - i) to max_length. Also, store the value of i and j-1 as start_index and end_index, respectively, as we need it while printing the longest subsequence.
When i=2 and j=6, B[j]=19 and B[i]=11. B[j] - B[i] = 8 => maxlength = 6 - 2 = 4
start_index = 2, end_index = 5.
Output the value of max_length and print all values from A[start_index] to A[end_index], separated by commas.
It was a moderately tricky problem. But somewhat of a common problem on Leetcode. First of all, I explained the naive O(n*n*n) solution to the interviewer. Then I took my time to come to a possible solution. Meanwhile, I came up with different ideas, and the interviewer listened to them patiently, offering suggestions. Eventually, I remembered a similar Leetcode problem I had solved using the cumulative sum approach, and I implemented it here. Luckily, it worked. The interviewer wasn’t too sure of this approach, so she listened to my explanation carefully and checked the code thoroughly. I gave a code walkthrough with the given example array to solidify my description. The interviewer was satisfied with the solution. She told me to wait for the next round.
  Round 3 :
4:45 PM. Time for the final round. I did some last-minute revision of Oracle the company while waiting for my turn. The interviewer was one of the coolest people I met; he eased even the littlest nerves I felt. First up were casual questions on how’s life in the pandemic and all that. Then he asked me if I were learning the same way as opposed to offline classes. I said I learned even better with all the help available on YouTube. I told him about the projects I did, which were a byproduct of the lockdown. He asked a few questions based on the courses that I listed on my resume, a long time back. I had started to forget about it but still managed to answer satisfactorily. Time for the first question.
He took MS Paint and gave a diagrammatic representation of the question, which translates to:
Suppose B is the child class of A, with added attributes and methods. b is an instance of B and a is an instance of A. Which statement executes without error: a = b or b = a?
I felt this was an intuitive question, so I relayed whatever logic came to my mind to the interviewer. If I told him the first one was right, he would tell another reason that makes the second statement feel right. Eventually, I ended up with this reasoning:
An object of B would have more size than an object of A since there are added attributes. So sizeof(b) > sizeof(a). An ‘=’ operator puts values in the RHS into the LHS variable. Now in statement b = a a’s attribute values cannot satisfy all of b’s attribute requirements. But in a = b b can satisfy all attribute requirements of a. So a = b is correct.
After an OOS quiz in S5, I realized this was a common question in Object-Oriented Programming.
DSA time. He asked me which was the data structure that had O(1) search time. I said hashtable. And few questions followed, asking what were the different methods to resolve collision in a hashtable, and I answered those correctly, explaining each of them.
Then there was a dice puzzle. 
Show all the dates of a month (01 to 31) by showing any face of the two die together. Appropriately place a digit from 0-9 on the two die faces given—one number on one face. Repetition is allowed.
I did not give the best possible answer, but he liked my improvisation in my first answer to make it correct.
My answer was we could fill 0,1,2,3,4,5 on Dice 1 and 0,1,2,6,7,8 on Dice 2. To display “19”, use 1 from Dice 1 and turn 6 upside-down from Dice 2. The interviewer was satisfied with my answer. (We could also give 9 instead of the 0 on Dice 2 as “00” is not required)
“What do you know about Oracle?”. I had read Wikipedia on Oracle beforehand, so I worded the answer perfectly with the facts. The interviewer was impressed. He asked me if I had any questions to ask. I had prepared three questions for this early on from the Oracle website, and I asked him two of those, to which he replied in detail. Afterwards, he asked me to leave the meeting and that the results would be announced through the TnP handle.
Later in the day, the results were announced, and 7 of us were selected for APPS.
Tips
Oracle’s software development uses a good amount of Java and SQL. So brush up your knowledge on those. 
Learning Python right from the basics. I know it’s not directly related to the interview, but I made sure I understood the OOPS concepts thoroughly along with Python. And that helped me solve the question in Round 3. If you have learnt Java earlier on, then go through the OOPS part once again.
Solving problems on Leetcode. I did only a dozen problems in total. But for each problem you do, make sure you learn it well. Keep notes if possible (will come in handy on the day before the interview)
Being expressive during the interview. Keep talking to the interviewer about whatever logic you are getting on your head. You will be surprised to know how helpful some interviewers are by giving you hints.
Remove those courses from your resume that you can’t recall. Keep a couple of those which are fresh in memory.
Research about the company and what questions to ask. Google is handy here. I read the Oracle wiki and remembered the key facts to tell if they asked me what do I know about the company. Also, type in what questions to ask an Oracle interviewer and use the same ones.
They told me my Github projects were too basic to ask questions from (Rock-Paper-Scissors, a Text-To-Speech program, etc.). And I admit it. I intended to keep it simple so that I could answer anything they asked about. Gladly, it didn’t backfire. So try having better projects and push your limits.

Confidence is key. But being confident does not mean being complacent. I knew I wasn’t strong in complex DSA, so I just hoped for the best. Be thorough in what you know. I researched almost A-Z about Oracle the moment I knew I was shortlisted since this was the first time I passed the online test of any company. At the same time, keep a level head that if things do not go your way, or if tough questions are asked, there is always another opportunity waiting for you. Best wishes.

 Round 1 : 
The First Round was an online test. It covered a range of portions such as DSA, C programming, Aptitude, Language and Grammar. The Test had 5 parts and each part was timed separately. Once the time for a particular part was over, you will not be able to return to it
Questions were asked based on basic DSA and DBMS concepts. It is highly advisable to brush up on these concepts before the test.
The test overall is very simple, but time is a huge constraint here. The test aims to see who will be able to solve the most in a short window of time. So in case if you are getting stuck somewhere, it is practical to move on and come back to the question if you have time
Round 2 : 
Round 2 was a Coding Interview Round. Students were allotted slots and were put into separate rooms with their interviewer. 
Always remember that the interviewer is there to help you. The interviewer was very nice and began with questions about my background and why ORACLE would seem like a good fit. Then he jumped right into the coding questions
The First Coding Question was a simple one. It was a question on Array Manipulation: We have 2 arrays, and our task is to Merge the two arrays in a sorted fashion. After doing this, I was asked to improve the time complexity of my code
The next question was about reading and evaluating an expression with brackets, for eg: (A + (B + C)). We are tasked with adding and removing brackets accordingly to make the expression minimal and correct. Hint: We do this with the help of a stack.
Finally, he finished off with some questions on OS and DBMS
Explain: Inheritance, Polymorphism
What is the difference between overloading and overwriting
Some basic SQL queries
  Round 3 :
Later in the evening, they called us for the next Round. This was partly a coding round as well as an HR round.
In the Coding problem, we were given a 2D array such as :  A, B, C
D, E
F, G, H, I, J
K. L. M
The objective of the program was to print all possible combinations where we select one item from each line
Such as : A, D, F, K
  B, D, F, K
  C, D, F, K
  A, E, F, K………………………..and so on
Then I was asked a series of HR questions. It is very important to prepare these beforehand so that you don’t fumble with your words. They asked me questions on projects that I listed on my Resume. It was an application development project which was perfect for the role that I was interviewing for and hence, they went in-depth with the technologies that I used and the concepts that I implemented. They also asked me basic HR questions such as my strengths and why I chose to work for ORACLE
Tips
DSA is key. You must devote a lot of your time to the preparation of DSA concepts as well as be able to implement them in various coding questions
Practicing on Leetcode is an extremely good way to get an edge on the coding rounds as well as interviews. Be sure you practice a lot on Leetcode
I know it is cliche but….confidence is key. Even if you are shaking nervously, under no circumstance should you show the interviewer your nervousness. Answer all questions with confidence. There is no penalty for getting answers wrong.
Spend a good time on questions that they give you in the interview and think clearly. But after some time, if you realize that your attempt is futile, let the interviewer know. Ask them for a hint on how to proceed, and I guarantee you, they will be willing to help.
An interview is a dialogue. Reciprocating your thought process is important. While attempting a problem, always let the interviewer know your thought process on how you will be tackling the problem. Sometimes if you stray away from the correct method, the interviewer may help you a little.
Ensure that the projects/courses you have listed on your resume are those you have full knowledge about. The interviewer will not shy away from digging deep into the projects that you claim to have done. If you have listed a project, brush up on everything that you did for the project.
Smile. No one wants to see your frown.
This is something no one else will tell you. PRACTICE HR QUESTIONS. Many of you are smart beyond your imagination. But what use is it if you cannot convey what you truly want to say? Don’t be embarrassed to prepare a script of what you are going to say beforehand...it helps a ton. Here are some HR questions I prepared:
Tell me a little bit about yourself
What are your strengths/weaknesses (....Please don’t say you have no weaknesses)
Why do you want to join ORACLE
Where do you see yourself in 5 years
What skills do you possess that are perfect/pertinent to this role
At the end, the interviewer might ask you if you have some questions for them. Use this time wisely. Ask them questions that show that you have an active interest in joining their company.
Others
You are more than talented to get an Internship. Believe that and do not fret no matter how many times you face rejections. Your confidence will help you where your skill cannot.
If you don’t get in, believe that there is something better for you
If you do get placed, help others. You might actually learn something new.
All the best

ORACLE APPS: PROJECT INTERN
AUTHOR : AKASH WILSON
Stipend: 100,000 per month
Number of rounds: 4
 Number of Test Round: 1
Number of Interview Rounds: 3
 Round 1: 
This round was conducted on Oracle’s platform. There were different sections in this round. Each round had its own time limit. As far as I can remember, there was no coding questions.
The sections consisted of questions from Operating Systems, Database Management Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, Object Oriented Systems, aptitude and language. The questions for OOS were written in Java, so it would be better to learn some basics of Java.
Round 2: 
This was the first interview round. The interviewer asked me to share my screen and to open up a text editor (not an IDE) specifically. He gave some basic DSA questions and puzzles to solve. I didn’t have to run the program.
Since I had a project (a full stack web application) in my resume, I had to give a brief summary of my project.
The interviewer was really friendly. He noticed that I had some anxiety and asked me to cool down.
He then asked me some HR related questions.
 Round 3:
This round was conducted shortly after the previous one. The interviewer gave me a lot of puzzles . It was sometimes a bit moderate, but was manageable.
He then went on asking questions from DSA. The questions were of intermediate level (mostly graph related), and I had to do these in C language.
Then there were some basic and intermediate SQL queries which I had to write.
This round, like the previous one, had some HR related questions.
Round 4: 
There was a huge delay between the 3rd and 4th rounds. I was really tired in this round. As far as I know, there was just me and one other student having 3 interview rounds.
I had to explain my project to the interviewer a bit more deeply. He asked a lot of theory from my project. The questions were mainly from networking,the API and packages I used for this project.
A basic question from DSA and a few puzzles were also asked. He then asked about my programming interests, and some other personal interests. Finally, we had a small chat about the company and I came to know that he was from our college.


Tips  
Make sure you prepare for company specific questions the day before.
Having projects in your resume is advantageous. But make sure you have an in-depth knowledge of these projects.
Make sure you are well versed with all the DSA concepts.
Look up some good puzzles from GFG prior to the interview.
Others
It is quite normal to be tensed for your interview. Try to be calm, the interviewers will mostly be really friendly.
It might be good if you share your thinking process with the interview.
On the day before, look up the interview questions and revise your DSA and project.
If you are not good with some concepts, it is okay to say that to the interviewer.
If the interviewer asks if you would like to learn something do not give a negative feedback.
Be confident.

AUTHOR : AJITH A
Stipend: Rs 1,00,000 per month 
Number of Rounds: 3 (1 Online Test, 2 Interview Rounds)
Online Test
MCQs on DSA, OS, DBMS, Aptitude
No negative marking
30 - 40 students were shortlisted for Interview rounds
Interview Round 1 
Started with discussions about the projects that I had done. 
Asked my favourite data-structure, I replied that I liked trees and heaps. Discussion continued along that path. Explained the definitions of trees and heaps, complete trees, graphs, and diff b/w graphs and trees. 
He asked me regarding the real life uses of heaps, I answered shortest path algorithms, and sorting(HeapSort). [Another answer would be Scheduling algorithms]
Then the discussion went on to sorting algorithms, he told me to write and explain any sorting algorithm that I knew. I didn't take any risk and wrote down bubble sort and also did a dry run for a test case. He seemed impressed with the explanation and the dry run and continued with another problem. 
He first told me to find the nth Fibonacci number, but then changed the qn to finding all the prime numbers from 1 to n.I gave him a brute force O(n^2) algorithm first, and he immediately told me he wanted a faster algorithm, probably an O(nlogn) one. As I didn't know a O(nlogn) solution, I proposed the method using a Sieve, which would roughly translate to O(n) time and space. 
He then started discussing my projects and asked me to explain each and every aspect of a project, from the database to the server logic. 
Around 10-12 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Interview Round 2 
The discussions in this round were mainly on my projects and a lot of time was spent on discussing how to improve and scale the project in certain use-cases. He asked me what data-structures would be best suited for each situation. 
Then there was a design question, related to some railway management system. Data would be flowing in at each second, and for each query consisting of two cities, we would be required to output the average time of travel b/w those two cities.The data was in the format (customer_id, starting_city, starting_time) and (customer_id, ending_city, ending_time). I suggested a solution using two hashtables and he told me that it was, in fact, the best possible solution for this problem. 
Another question was one which I didn't completely understand, but we would be given an n-ary tree which was a specific encoding of an XML code. We would be required to convert the tree into XML code, a matrix form, and sometimes back to the tree structure. When I finally came up with the algorithm, he asked another question, what's the minimum iterations over the tree required to construct the matrix form. I initially replied with the most brute-force answer, but further optimised it to give him the correct answer. 
He finally asked two HR questions and asked me whether I had any questions for him. 
The results were announced the same day, and 7 students got selected.
Tips
Don't panic during the interview
Don't bluff 
It's better to accept that you don't have a certain level of knowledge in some topic, than to speak about things which you're not too confident about
Speak out Loud. Let the interviewer know about your thought process in arriving at a solution, even if your solution isn't correct or optimal.
Make sure that you know your projects inside-out
Practice coding questions….
All the best !!

 Online Test Round 1 : 
  The online test for us was purely MCQ based, with no coding questions. There were multiple sections including general aptitude and English aptitude. There was a technical section with questions related to general programming concepts as well. I remember quite a few questions on binary trees and other types of trees with pointers, so be fluent with those. HTML status codes and their meanings (Eg 200=>success, 300=>redirect) were asked too. 39 students were selected for the interview stage for the Server Tech role.
Interview Round 1 : 
 Round 1 was taken via Zoom by a manager who tested my basic programming skills. He asked me about my knowledge of algorithms and made me code binary sort and do a dry test run using an example he gave. He also posted a few questions that were Java-based where I had to guess the output. I didn’t have any experience with Java but gave it a shot and explained why I thought they were viable outputs and he was happy.
Interview Round 2 : 
 Round 2 was taken via Zoom as well. Round 2 proved to be more technical - where I had to explain the projects in my resume and show some code I had written for them. I was asked how I would modify my code based on certain use cases and how I would approach a certain error in my code as well. 
Tips 
 Before the interview, I read the document shared by the company which expressed how the interview would take place and what they expected of the interns as well. The document gave important tips as well, like the STAR method to reply to questions.
 Try not to say no to a technical question. Say something like “I'm not sure but If I were to approach it from my current perspective, I would …..” and give it a shot. Ask doubts and converse with your interviewer as well and they will help you out. Try not to get stuck on a question. Think aloud and explain your method - interviewers will help you along the way as well. Basically, be confident and always give a genuine attempt to what they ask. 
 Practice coding via sites like Leetcode and practice the algorithms you learned in class during PD and DSA, and try to be familiar with concepts in CO, Networking, DBMS, and OS as they’re asked during the MCQ rounds to shortlist students too.

 Online Test Round 1 : 
  The first round was MCQ-based, with multiple sections including general aptitude, and English (comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, etc). No questions involved coding, instead, the test contained dedicated sections to assess knowledge of coding. 
Questions spanned across topics like trees (many of them from AVL trees), pointers, and DSA in general. The questions were lengthy and it was difficult to go through all questions in the allotted time.
Around 40 students were selected for the interview stage for the Server Tech role.
Interview Round 1 : 
The interview took place via Zoom. The interviewer began off by introducing himself and asked me to do the same. He then asked me several questions on OS concepts and asked me to explain them. Some of them that I remember are segmentation, priority inversion, garbage collection, dangling pointers, sockets, threads, etc. He then asked me to share the screen and code, but I faced issues with sharing the screen which took almost 5 minutes to resolve ( leaving, rejoining, and switching browsers). So take note to make sure that everything’s working fine beforehand itself. The coding questions were:
Find the size of an array passed to a function ( search the web for an array to pointer decay for some really good insight )
Reverse a linked list
Copy a string to another
 Interview Round 2 : 
I had to wait around 2 hours in a meeting room before moving on to the second round of the interview. The interview started with the interviewer introducing himself and as usual, asking me to introduce myself. He was particularly interested in my academics and co-curricular activities and urged me to talk more about them. He then asked me to explain the projects that I had done. After that, he inquired how proficient I was in OS concepts, SQL, and machine learning, but did not proceed to ask any questions about those topics. He then asked me to explain what I knew about cloud services and Oracle. After that, he asked me to pick a language and write a program to reverse a string. I wrote the solution in python. He was satisfied. He then asked whether I had any questions and then wished me luck.
Tips 
Revise general interview topics like OS concepts, OOS, and DSA
Do not blindly guess. It’s fine to tell if you don’t know about a topic.
Practice questions from websites like leetcode, geeksforgeeks
Relax, don’t let stress get better of you. No need for last-minute revisions, instead talk with your friends and chill before heading into the interview session and most importantly don’t forget to smile.

 Online Test Round 1 : 
This was the only online test that we had. The test was divided into 5 parts where they asked MCQs regarding aptitude, English skills (Comprehension, grammar, etc.), and various CS topics. There were a lot of questions focused on all kinds of trees including binary trees and AVL trees. They also asked many questions regarding various HTTP status codes where you had to choose an appropriate one for the scenario mentioned. Some of the questions were lengthy and the time was extremely limited, so I had to guess some of the questions at the end. They followed a similar format last year too. So, I would recommend focusing on these topics mentioned (in geeksforgeeks or something) and not wasting time during the test.
Interview Round 1 : 
For interviews, you will be put into a zoom room along with others where you will have to wait for your chance. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself at the end of which I mentioned a project I was working on. He then proceeded to ask a few basic questions regarding the project. He then asked me my language of choice (which was C++) and asked if I knew STL and went on to ask some basic questions related to hashmap. After that, he asked me to open a notepad and share my screen to write some code. The first question he asked me was to find 2 elements in a sorted array whose sum is a given target. This was a basic leetcode question. So, I just mentioned the brute force method and then went on to explain and code a more optimized version. 
Then he asked me the second question which was to count the number of trailing zeros in a factorial. I had solved this question a few weeks before the interview. So, I had some ideas on how to approach it. As usual, I started with the brute force approach and then started to explain and code the optimized version. After coding, he gave me a sample case and asked me to identify the error in the code. It took me some time but I was finally able to find the error and correct the code. He was fine with that and asked me if I had any questions. I asked a couple of general questions (like what kind of work he does or something like that) and then he told me to wait for the next interview.
Interview Round 2 : 
This was a really chill interview. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself first and asked me to give a summary of all the subjects we had in the second year. Thankfully, his questions were limited to these subjects only. Then he took a look at my resume and proceeded to ask a lot of questions about the projects that I mentioned. He really went deep into the projects and asked me to code an algorithm I used and to find its time complexity. So, I would recommend going through your projects and understanding what every single line of code does. He asked a lot of non-CS questions and was really keen on having a conversation. So, this was kind of like a technical + HR round. In the end, he asked if I had any questions and the interview was done.

Tips 
Use your summer vacation wisely and practice as many Leetcode problems as possible.
Be confident while talking and try to not panic if you are unable to solve a question for example.
Ask the interviewer questions regarding the problems they give and make sure you understand them properly.
Try to research the company and go through various online resources to understand the type of questions they ask before attempting the test.

  Online Test Round 1 - I applied for the ST role. This round consisted of MCQ questions from CS Concepts, Basic DSA(AVL Trees, Binary Search Tree, Stacks, Queues), Computer Networks, Database, aptitude, maths, and comprehension. The questions were lengthy and it was difficult to go through all the questions in the allotted time.
Around 40 students were selected for the interview stage after this round.
Interview round 1:
The interview took place on Zoom. I was asked a modified version of the balancing parenthesis question. I was asked about the data structure which I could use to solve this problem which was a stack. I was also asked to dry run my code on 2 sample inputs which the interviewer provided. I was also asked to specify the time and space complexity of my code. 
Interview Round 2: I had to wait for around 2 hours in a meeting before moving to the second round of interviews. The interviewer introduced himself and then asked for my introduction. He asked about my hobbies and the clubs I was a part of in college. He then asked about the projects that I had made and asked me to open my GitHub to download one of my projects and then I was asked to present my screen and show that my project was running successfully.
I was also asked to explain my project in detail and about the libraries and in-built functions I had used in my project.
Tips
 a)Practise questions from Codechef, Codeforces, Leetcode, and Atcoder to improve your problem-solving abilities to clear coding rounds and interviews.
 b)You should have decent projects in your resume on web development or machine learning or android development.
 c)You should have a good knowledge of all data structures. You can refer to geeks for geeks to learn about them.
 d)You must know the basics of database management systems and OOPS.
 e)Be confident during interviews and if you don’t know the answer to any question never try to make a blind guess.

 Round 1:
I applied for both apps and st roles. This round consisted of MCQ questions. It tested our technical knowledge and included questions both from our academic curriculum ( trees, SQL, bits of network) as well as from our English vocabulary and general programming questions and their outputs.
        Round 2:
I was among the 39 who got selected from Round 1. Round 2 was organized in the zoom platform which lasted 20- 25 minutes. Firstly he asked me to say something about myself, here I focused my answer on my volunteering and leadership opportunities. This was followed up by 3 easy coding questions. 1. Finding string length 2. Finding a given number odd/ even. 3. Reversing a number
The interviewer was allowed to choose between c/java/python, it differs from the interviewer. Finally, he asked me about virtual memory, dynamic memory, threading,  cache, and page faults and concluded with feedback.
        Round 3: 
 This round appeared after around 2.5 hrs of waiting and a duration of around 30 min in zoom. This round focused more on the project I developed during the vacation and went into its details. The interviewer also enquired about my favorite subjects and my reason for choosing the electives and the interviewer put forward questions related to binary, RB trees, and their applications, questions were constructed out of my answers. Finally, the session ended by asking for feedback, talking about the company as well as about the interviewer
Tips:
1. It's ok to say you “don't know” to questions you actually have not much idea about. Otherwise, the follow-up questions will get you into trouble. Better stop than getting stuck. If you are desperate to answer in areas you have little idea then say to the interviewer that you are not well versed in that area in the most polite way and then share your thoughts regarding the subject.
2. I did research about the company, its offices in India as well as outside, and major achievements( like they own java). Try adding this info in your interaction if possible but don't make it look rubbish.
3. Have a smiling and obedient face and talk from your experience for a continuous and confident flow of your language
4. Try to conclude your answers towards areas you are confident at. This helps you to answer better in the follow-up questions.
5. Luck - is a big factor. I was lucky enough to get good interviewers as well as good questions and fortunate enough to crack my first interview itself. Some may fall out in the first round itself while some in the last round, it's all about waiting for that lucky day to arrive with your decent enough cgpa and speaking skills

Stipend: Rs 25,000
Number of rounds: 1
There was no online test, and the selection for the interview was solely based on resume and CGPA (wasn’t so hard on CGPA since even people with a CGPA of 7 were called for the interview).
The interview was quite fun, and the interviewer was a chill person. First, we introduced ourselves, and then we talked about my projects which were mentioned in my resume. And then, there was a series of 5 sub-rounds with different types of questions.
Coding Round
There were 2 coding questions which were pretty easy. The questions weren’t based on DSA. It was just based on basic logic, the interviewer just wanted to see the process of me formulating the solutions. The questions I got were a variation of the questions below.
Maximum difference in frequency
Add 2 numbers
OOPS related questions
I was asked if I knew OOPS concepts, and since I answered yes, she asked me a few basic questions from OOPS.
To explain abstraction and encapsulation and differentiate between both of them.
Explain the concept of polymorphism and different types of polymorphism.
Software testing
This was an odd round which I didn’t expect or even hear of from any of my friends who got placed before me. So, I was surprised to see this question, and it took me some time to get around the question and what I had to do.
The interviewer gave me a problem statement, which actually was the requirements of an app and some details on the design and implementation of that app. Given these, I was asked to formulate 5 test cases for the app to test its functionality.
Basic math
In this round, she asked me a probability question which was also pretty easy, but the main focus here was how I got to the solution rather than if I could get to a solution and therefore, I had to explain each step and why I was thinking like that. This was the question- 3 ants and a triangle.
Puzzle
This was the question Bulb with 3 switches.
The question was a pretty tricky question and it isn’t a question which many people can come up with the correct answer on the first try, but to my luck I had seen this question earlier, therefore I tried acting a bit like I was working it out in my head and directly told the right answer which was 1. As I told the right answer, I could see in her face she wasn’t expecting that in the first try, she then asked me for the explanation, after I gave the right explanation and told that the guy could “touch the bulb to see if it was hot” she seemed like she understood that I’ve seen the question previously and she tried to joke around asking “What if he gets electrocuted?” with a smirk XD.
After all the rounds we talked a bit more, and I asked her more about education, career and life in Strand and also talked a bit about our hobbies and things we do during leisure time.
Tips
While writing about your projects, do not bluff around. In the interview round, you can expect really deep questions based on the projects mentioned in your resume.
Even if you can’t answer a question or 2, you might get selected. So don’t panic and if at all you do, don't show it to the interviewer. Confidence plays a really big role in interviews.

There was no coding round and the selection was based on CGPA and resume. There was only one round of interview, in which for me it was full of DSA questions. The questions were:
Reversing a string and reversing words in a sentence
Stack using queue and queue using stack
Maximum profit of stock. It was an array based question which you can find online. 
I could answer all of them properly and later that day I got selected.

AUTHOR: SANIL MISHRA
Stipend: 40,000 Rs per month 
7 days of stay in a hotel (reimbursement of max 3k per day), 2AC tickets to Bangalore and back to college, one-time local conveyance reimbursement.  
Number of rounds: 4
Number of Test Rounds  = 2 (online)
Number of Interview Rounds = 2 (online)
Round 1:
  It was mostly an online coding and mathematical ability round where questions from both sections were asked.

Round 2:
After some of us were shortlisted, we were sent a link where we basically had to play a few games. This was so that they knew if we fit into their company.

Round 3:
This was our first interview round. Since I had projects added to my resume all of the questions asked to me were related to my project. Questions were very simple provided you know exactly what you have done in your project.
Round 4:
This was mainly an HR round where a senior member of the company interacted with us. 
The questions were mostly typical HR questions like "Give me an example of how you have worked in a group recently and when there was a problem that occurred you handled it." There were a few questions regarding my projects once again as well.
TIPS:
The best way to escape coding and hardcore technical questions in the interview round is by having projects included in your resume. If you do not have projects then a good understanding of DSA would be necessary.
Resources: 
Questions in the coding round were pretty simple so a decent knowledge of DSA will be enough.

Round 1 (Online Test):
There were multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in the evaluation, which tested the knowledge of the candidates on various topics including Aptitude, Operating Systems (OS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), and English Grammar. In addition to these MCQs, there were also two coding questions that were part of the assessment.
One of the coding questions was similar to this:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-distance-between-two-nodes-of-a-binary-tree 
Another one is related to expression evaluation.

Round 2 (Pymetrics Test):
It is a game-based assessment that evaluates a candidate's cognitive and personality traits to determine job fit. Since it is a game-based assessment, candidates do not need to prepare in advance for this assessment.

Round 3 (Technical Interview):
During my technical interview, I was first asked to introduce myself, followed by a coding challenge to print Fibonacci numbers. The interviewer then asked me to modify the code to handle a scenario where the user inputs non-numeric characters.
Remain calm and clearly express your thought process to succeed in the technical interview, especially when tackling a coding question.
Round 4 (HR Interview):
The interview was easy-going, and the interviewer asked me to talk about myself. Then, she asked some usual questions like "What do you want to do in the future?". Later, she asked if I would feel comfortable working in Bangalore. This made me think I might get the internship.
7 students were eventually selected for this role.

Round 1 (Online Test):
The Hiring Team conducted an On-Campus Test on a Digital Platform. The test 
comprised of 5 Sections in total (Aptitude, Logical Reasoning, Grammar, Technical 
MCQs, and 2 Coding Questions). 
One of the coding questions is similar to this one on geeks for geeks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-distance-between-two-nodes-of-a-binary-tree/
Another question was a relation expression evaluation. The below question is a similar question 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/expression-evaluation/
Approximately 20 were selected for the further rounds.
Round 2 (Pymetric Test):
This round was not as difficult as the others. Pymetric Test is nothing to be very serious 
about, you are judged based on your various capabilities of Decision Making, Quickness, and Fluidity in different situations. It is a game-based assessment and prior preparation is not required. No one was eliminated in this round. 
People were shortlisted for the technical round based on their CVs. Approximately 8 were selected for the next round.
Round 3 (Technical Round):
The interview started with the typical HR question
"Introduce Yourself?"
Later a set of questions were asked one the concepts of OOPS, here are a few questions they asked
1) Explain Polymorphism?
2) What is Static?
3) What does the term Virtual mean and where do we use it?
A question related to linked lists was asked: 
Detect the presence of a loop in a linked list, if present determine the starting point and remove the loop. I shall share the link to practice the question here https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-loop-in-a-linked-list/
I was asked questions related to STL as I was a C++ coder, few of them were
1) What is the difference between ordered and unordered maps?
2) Why do you use STL?
3) Explain the mechanism used in the sort function of STL?
Later I was asked to explain the project which I was working on.
The interview ended with a HR question: 
What would you do if you get a role which you don’t like to work?
Round 4 (HR):
This round started with a typical HR question to introduce myself. 
I was asked about my location, and where I was originally from (I was from Hyderabad). 
She asked me "Why did you join NITC while having so many nice colleges in Hyderabad?" 
I was asked questions about the project which I was working on. 
She asked me, Why GE? 
7 people were selected in the end.
TIPS:
• Never mention things that are unknown to you in your resume.
• HR related questions can be asked in any round.
• Do not try to outsmart the interviewer, if you do not know anything just say it.
• Go through previous interview experiences in geeks for geeks.

Round 1 (Online Test):
There were two parts to this test. First was an MCQ test in topics like Operating Systems, Database Management, and General Aptitude. The coding test had two questions. One was related to expression evaluation and the other one was on binary trees. 
The questions were not hard. Try to solve as many problems as possible on sites like Leetcode, Hackerrank, and have a basic idea of OS and DBMS to prepare for this round.
Round 2 (Pymetrics Test):
This was a game-based assessment where they aim to match each intern with a 
role. The game presents certain scenarios and tasks to understand one's approach 
towards a problem. 
This round was fairly simple and it was not mandatory to complete all the tasks.
Round 3 (Technical Interview):
The interviewer asked me to introduce myself, what programming languages I was comfortable in, and asked whether I had done any projects. I was given a coding problem (Unfortunately I can’t recall the exact problem) and he gave me various modifications to it. 
In this round, try to be calm and communicate with the interviewer about your thought process as they are more focused on your approach and technique rather than the code itself.
Round 4 (HR Interview):
It was a typical HR interview. He asked me to introduce myself, asked me my strengths and weaknesses, where I see myself in 5 years.
7 students were selected after this round.

Number of rounds: 2 
Number of Test Rounds  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 1
Round 1:
It was a coding round. It was an onscreen online test on Hackerrank. They asked two coding questions. I don’t remember the questions exactly but both of them were on “Binary Search”. One was about “Priority Queue” & other was about “Upper Bound”. Both of them were easy but I didn’t know the concept of these topics so I did the brute force approach. Using that, I managed to get 7 test cases correct out of 11 in the 1st question and 8 test cases correct out of 12 in the 2nd question.
Round 2:
 
It was an interview round. I went to the CCD building to give the interview (as it was made compulsory by them). My interview was at 3 pm but my laptop was not able to connect with CCD wifi. The person conducting my interview contacted CCD and inquired about my delayed joining, as it was already 3:10.  After so much hard work and changing rooms I manage to join google meet 12 minutes late. She started the interview by introducing herself and then told me to introduce myself. I had written the whole introduction. I spitted that out in front of her. But as I joined late she was a little bit pissed off. So she stopped me and gave me one coding question on hackerrank because I told her in the introduction that I focused on coding. The question’s story was so long and confusing. I read that question twice. After understanding that question I just laughed in my mind cause the question was so easy. I just have to do the sum of all the even indexed elements and odd indexed elements of an array and have to tell which one is bigger. I wrote the code and show her the correct output. She attempted to discuss Web Development with me, but I mentioned that I hadn't fully delved into that subject yet. Consequently, she inquired about the topic I felt at ease discussing at that moment.  As my interview was after 4 days after the result of round 1 got released I revised Object Oriented Programming well. So I told her OOPs. Then she started to ask me questions about OOPS. I managed to answer every question except one which I tried to answer but I was wrong. She corrected me and then she asked me whether I had any questions for her. I said no and she concluded the interview. As there was only one interview round, the result came at night and my name was there in the list.
 
TIPS :
 
During the Summer vacation of 2nd year do as much coding as you can. Give contests on Codechef, Codeforces. For DSA questions and Dynamic programming questions follow Leetcode and Geeks For Geeks as interviewers ask on these topics more.
 
     By chance, if you get selected for the interview then first prepare a good Introduction that includes your name, birthplace, and school name from where you have completed 10th and 12th. What extracurricular activities you have done after coming to college? Which curricular activities you have completed in college? Never mention a topic or subject at which you are not good at or you have not studied.  Also, don’t add anything that you don’t know in your resume. Because the interviewer mostly asks about the topics you mention in the introduction or during the interview or topics that are included in your projects and mentioned in your resume. If they ask anything from the resume or topic you mentioned and if you don’t know the answer then it will create a bad impression. And also never ever show off in front of your interviewer if they took this thing in their mind then no one can stop your rejection. And yeah be confident during the interview but not overconfident if you don’t know the answer to any question then just say so, cause there is nothing wrong in that. If you say no then they won’t judge you on that topic and will ask you questions about another topic.

Round 1: Online Test 
• The online test was about an hour. 
• It consisted of 2 coding questions. 
• First question was based on arrays and it was an easy question. 
• Second question was based on arrays and priority queues and it was an easy to moderate level question, the question was about the lottery machine having 3 columns (having integer entries) and we have to output the number of ways a person can win the lottery with the given sum (sum of numbers obtained in each column) and there was another set of conditions regarding column entry obtained. 
• In my case, i had done the two questions successfully. 
• Around 15-20 members were shortlisted for interview. 
Round 2: Managerial + HR 
• It was about 30 minutes. 
• It started with introducing myself and how I ended up in NITC and asked why i chose NITC. • Later asked about the problems faced during corona and later asked to provide some solutions for them, especially about education (like online teaching ). 
• Then asked whether I have done a project and I said no. I explained why I don’t have a project on my resume. So make sure that u have one on your resume so that u can kill time by explaining your project. 
• She then asked me to describe the IRCTC app and its functionalities and asked about which payment method I will choose and why and the improvements that can be made to the app. 
• Asked about pros and cons of a group project and how would i resolve the conflict that arose between group members. 
• Asked whether I had knowledge of cloud storage and services and i said no. Then she explained the basic concept of cloud storage and asked questions like how a company will choose a cloud storage provider and what types of cloud storage I will choose that will be in the best interest of the company(like protection,cost etc) and why I chose it. 
• Asked why I am willing to join visa and the reason for my interest in joining, and the functions of visa and it ended with a couple of questions from my side. 
• It was quite chill overall and the results were announced the next day, a total of 10 members were selected for the internship. 
TIPS: 
Keep coding throughout the vacation, at least two problems a day from hackerrank or leetcode.  Better if you have a project on your resume it helps to kill time in interviews.  Don’t keep a thing on your resume that you haven’t done or learned.  Better prepare for introducing yourself before the interview.  Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it.  Do some research about the company,its functions, and its motto before going to the interview.  Don’t think they will ask about the company only in the HR round, they might ask in any round(it happened to me in an interview for another company).  Make sure you properly read the job description if given.

There were 2 coding questions and 1 hour time.
1. Longest Work Slot 26 nurses have employee numbers 0 through 25 that map to ids 'a' through ' z '. They work in shifts beginning at time 0, and only one works at a time. When one stops, the next nurse begins immediately. Given the employee numbers and the times at which their shifts end in a 2-D array where each element is [employee number, leave time], find the ID of the nurse with the longest single shift. 
2. A foundry in Hackerland makes an alloy out of n different metals. In the manufacturing of an alloy, the composition of each metal is fixed, where the required quantity of the ith metal in preparing 1 unit of the alloy is denoted by composition[i]. The company already has stock[i] units of metal i in their stock. The company has a budget to purchase any of the metals if needed. The cost of ith metal is cost[i] per unit. Find the maximum units of alloys the company can produce by using available stock plus what they can purchase within their budget. 
Interview Round: 
For me, this was more of an HR round rather than a Technical round. The Technical questions were: 
How Memory is allocated for a C++ program 
Difference between Static variables and global variables and the scope of those variables 
Then there were questions like 
● Tell me briefly about yourself? 
● Why Visa is the company you should work in? 
● What are your strengths and weaknesses? As I didn't have any project in my Resumé the interviewer didn't ask about that.

Round 1 (Test):
 
This was an Online Assessment conducted on HackerRank.
The duration was 1 hour.
The test had 2 questions of Intermediate level.
 
Q1: The first question involved traversing through a 2D matrix, and calculating a    certain sum based on the values in the cells. The solution involved making an algorithm by modifying DFS. I passed 10/15 test cases.
 
Q2. For the second question, I was given coordinates of 3 points that form a triangle, and 2 other arbitrary points. I had to find out if the 3 points form a proper triangle, and which of the 2 other points lie inside the triangle. There were a lot of corner cases (because implementing mathematical formulae led to divisions by zeroes and other funky things). I was able to pass 43/50 test cases.
Round 2 (Interview 1): 
The interview for interns was only one round. It started with her introducing herself and her role in VISA, and then asking me to tell her about myself, my background, hobbies etc. 
She then asked me to describe one of my projects, and asked a few questions about what made me choose this as a project, how I started off, and what I had to learn. She asked me about the Software Development Life Cycle and how I applied it to the project.
Then she asked me how I would design an app like yatra.com for flight bookings, and then asked what I would improve in the existing app.
She then asked me about my views on AI, and my opinions on whether an AI learning from data should have human intervention. We then talked about AI and its shortcomings for a bit.
She then asked me a few generic HR questions:
o   One major strength and weakness of mine.
o   Why VISA? Also, how would hiring me benefit the company?
o   Give an example of you handling a huge responsibility or high pressure and describe how you did it.
o   Give an example where you showcased your collaborative skills.
We then talked for a while casually about generic topics, and then she asked me if I had any questions for her. I asked her about her role in the company that she had mentioned while introducing herself.
After a few hours, we were informed of the results.
 
Tips: 
Tone of conversation: 
Try and match the tone of the interviewer, for example, in my case she was semi-casual from the beginning while we introduced each other, and formal while asking me for technical explanations. I kept my answers in a similar tone to hers.
Projects: 
A general advice for any company would be to prepare a description of your major projects. This should include the language/s used, what you learned before starting it, the stages of development, challenges faced, what you learned after completion, etc.
 
Others: 
After the selection in VISA, the perks and benefits provided for the internship period included everything, including travel both ways, accommodation throughout the internship, reimbursement for all travel costs during the internship, all meals and laundry daily, and so on. So you needn’t worry as much if relocation to a new city was one of your worries.

Round 1: Coding Round 
i. The coding test was conducted on the SHL platform. There were 2 questions to solve within 45  minutes and the questions were pretty easy. There were different sets of questions given out.
ii. The first question in my set was to count the number of occurrences of a particular character in a  given string. For example, if the string is “interviewdiaries” and the given character is ‘d’, then you have  to print how many times ‘d’ occurs in this string.
iii. The second question in my set was to print the alternate sort of a given unsorted array. The alternate  sort of an array is the alternate elements of a sorted array. Essentially all you have to do is to sort the  given unsorted array and then return elements which are at alternate elements. For example, if the  array is [1,9,2,5,7], the answer to return is [1,5,9].
iv. A total of 15 people were shortlisted for interviews.
Round 2: Coding / Riddle / Technical Interview 
i. The interview started off very chill and the interviewer set a very calm tone for the interview by asking  basic questions about myself like my introduction, my background and how my morning had been.  After the introduction was over, she went through my resume and saw that I had three projects listed  there. She went through each of my projects and asked me to explain what they were, how they were  implemented (details regarding tech-stack) and which of the three was my favourite. She asked if I  could show her a running demo of the same, which I could not at the time as I had been using a  different laptop than the one on which my project was ready to run. She then proceeded to ask me  how much I knew about cloud computing but this was not a subject I had yet explored so I told her  that my knowledge in this domain is very primitive and told her the basics of what I knew in the  domain. She then asked me a few HR related questions like why do I want to work at SAP Labs and  what are my plans for the future with respect to career after B. Tech. She then gave me the  opportunity to ask her any questions I had so I took some time to ask her a few questions. The whole  interview round took about 25 minutes.
13 out of the initial 15 were shortlisted for the second round.
Round 3: Technical Interview 
This round started off with the interviewer asking me to introduce myself and then to explain my favourite project to him, which was a project built on the Object Oriented Paradigm that could find its place in a bank kiosk, at least that was the idea behind the project. Upon mentioning this, he asked me two questions which could happen in a real world scenario. First, he asked me to assume that my application is on a bank kiosk at a branch and that one feature of the application is not working due to which there are rising accounts of customer dissatisfaction. How would I detect what the issue is? To this I answered that firstly I would analyse all of the customers’ feedback in order to fully understand what the problem faced by them is. Then I would look at which all functionalities are affected by the problem that is being encountered and finally go deep into the specific functions that are causing the error and debug them line by line to see what is going wrong. He was satisfied with this answer and asked me a follow up question, wherein he asked me how I would present this problem to my manager keeping in mind that the manager need not know the in-depth workings of the code, he only needs to know what the problem is very briefly. To this I answered that I would first carry out all the steps I mentioned in my previous answer by myself to find the exact issue. Then while reporting to my manager I would keep it clear and concise and tell him that the customers have complained regarding a certain issue after which a thorough investigation was done into the problem. This revealed that the problem is with so and so functionality and my team and I believe that this(a proposed solution) could be the fix for the issue. I would also reassure him that the fix will be implemented ASAP and let him know of the team’s progress. He was very satisfied with this answer. This round concluded very quickly as my interviewer had another meeting to attend on short notice but since I’d given answers that he was happy with it.
I was one of 8 people to be shortlisted to the next round.
Round 4: Technical Interview 
i. This was my longest interview round and it was conducted by one of the VPs. The interviewer was super friendly and set a very chill atmosphere for the entirety of the round. In fact, in the beginning, after my introduction he asked me what all questions I’d been asked so far and upon hearing it all he joked that my managerial round was over in the last two rounds and that he was going to take my technical round.He then told me to explain one of my projects to him in a reasonably detailed manner and that he would pick up something from my explanation. I picked the same bank kiosk project and explained it to him. Right off the bat he asked me what is unique about my project to which I replied that this is a project to showcase my coding skills using object oriented programming and that it didn’t necessarily include anything unique. He then asked me what was the toughest part of the project to which I answered - database design. I told him it was hard coming up with a normalized database and deciding what all needs to be stored and in what way. He then asked me if in a real life bank scenario, would more normalization help increase efficiency? I got this answer wrong and he then explained to me why data redundancy is actually beneficial in such large sensitive databases. He also asked me why I chose the tech stack I chose for my project and then talked about his experience with the same tech stack. He then asked me how I would design a dictionary from scratch. The answer he was looking for is a hashmap where you store key-value pairs with the key being a string and the value being some sort of a list that contains the meaning of the given word. I started off by saying we could store a mapping of the given word and an array of strings, which would store each meaning of the word. But since this won’t be space efficient I upgraded my solution to replace the array of strings by a linked list of strings, so that each node is one meaning to the given word. This approach also solves the hashmap collision issue by using the chaining mechanism. He then asked me how I would map a string, because a normal mapping is from a number as the key and here I am trying to use a string as a key. I replied saying that I would develop a hashing mechanism, for example, by adding all the ASCII values of each character of the string and use that as the key instead. The next question he asked me was to retrieve the second highest salary from a given table of employee details (https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/ ). I explained to him the functionality of the LIMIT and OFFSET keywords and then told him the MySQL code for the same. He asked me to come up with another approach to solving this question so I suggested sorting the entire salary column in descending order and selecting the second value. He said that this solution would work but if there are over one million entries in this table, then to find one value we have to sort the entire table. He wanted me to come up with one more approach and gave me a hint of using aggregate functions. I knew it was something to do with the max function but I didn’t quite string it together on the spot. I told him a solution I had which was to first find the max salary from the entire table and temporarily remove that tuple from the table, then run the max function on the salary column once more. This would be the required value and then we re-insert the deleted tuple back into the table. But this approach has too much of a risk in case the user forgets to re-insert the tuple into the table. He tried to push me to an answer but I couldn’t get it at the time. Just before he moved onto the next question I asked him for the solution to this question and he replied with the nested queries with max function approach (https://leetcode.com/problems/second-highest-salary/solutions/3480126/easy-to-understand/ ). Finally he asked me if I had any questions for him and I took the next 15 or so minutes to ask him several questions regarding his line of work and the company itself.
7 out of 8 people were shortlisted for the HR round after this round.
Round 5(HR Round):
 The interviewer introduced herself and then asked me to introduce myself after which she asked me why I wanted to work at SAP. She’d asked me why I don’t have an internship section in my resume to which I replied that I didn’t get an internship in my third year which is why I spent the last few months upskilling and working on myself. I made it a point that being able to sit for the interviews was a testament to my hard work. She seemed satisfied with this answer and then asked me if I’d attended the pre-placement talk the day before. I replied saying that I had attended it and that I remembered her talk in the event as well. She said that she’d ask me some questions related to the PPT and firstly asked me how the PPT was and how they could improve on it. She then asked if I had any job location or job role preference. After this I got to ask a few questions and then the round concluded. Finally 5 out of 7 were selected for the job.
TIPS: 
a. For the coding round, try to get the most optimized solution in the shortest time possible. Do not spend all 45 minutes on your test if the questions are very straightforward. SAP usually shortlists based on time taken to solve questions and how optimized your solution is.
b. Make sure you know your projects inside out.
c. Be very confident in what you say if you know what you’re saying. Confidence is key.
d. Don’t be afraid to say “I don’t know” when you don’t know the answer to something.
e. Always keep questions about the company ready to ask the interviewer at the end of each round. This shows your interest to work for the company and it boosts your case massively.

Number of rounds: 4
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 1
Round 1: Coding Round 
They asked 2 coding questions (Both were very easy and solvable in 5 mins) 
(1) Sort first k elements in ascending and rest in descending 
(2) Count certain number of elements in an array 
Round 2: Coding / Riddle / Technical Interview 
They asked 1 or 2 Coding questions straight away and asked some aptitude questions along with OOPS. 
(1) Coding Round Medium question was Kadane’s algorithm (Largest Sum Contiguous Subarray)
(2) Some question related to max-heaps 
(3) Few aptitude questions from GFG ( rat poisoning and horse racing, gold brick cutting etc..) 
(4) OOPS Concepts, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction.
(5) Resume, if you have projects, the interviewer may ask about them. My interviewer was impressed with my work and asked some oops concepts I used in one of the projects mentioned in my resume. 
Feedback was great as I almost solved coding questions and got all aptitude questions ( some partially ). I showed the will to learn when the interviewer was ready to give hints and this was well taken.
Round 3: Technical Interview 
About the questions asked 
(1) Interviewer mainly focussed on OOPs ( same concepts as in Round 2 ) and my resume. 
(2) Presentation skills (although subtly) about your projects along with OOPS theory was checked. 
Feedback was positive and they were satisfied with all the questions asked
Round 4: HR Round 
Asked about personality and background. No particular feedback was hinted at by the interviewer.
TIPS: 
Revise coding problems which you solved. For me I had solved Kadane's algorithm problem but there was some small tweak which I forgot at the moment. My approach was well explained and the interviewer understood I had the right idea. In order to avoid situations like these, always update these tricks or tweaks in a notebook after you solve a coding question and revise them properly. 
Be thorough with OOPs. You don't need to be skilled with an OOPs language but know the basics well. 
Go through all riddles in GFG. 
SAP generally asks array based problems more.
Do ask for feedback.

Number of Interview Rounds = 1
Round 1: Online Test 
There were two coding questions to solve in 1 hour. 
The question was like array type questions in Leetcode. 
Everyone attending the test had a different set of questions but all easy types. 
The main point is to solve them in the most efficient way or to find the solution with the lowest time complexity. There will be a lot of candidates who solve both questions, but it is important to do it with the best time complexity. 
34 people were shortlisted for the next rounds. 
Round 2: Technical Interview 
It was a technical interview for about 20 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and made me feel very comfortable. o Interview began with a rundown of the resume. Have at least one good project in it. A few questions were asked regarding my project. 
Basic OOP concepts were asked. 
I was asked to write a code snippet showcasing the inheritance property. 
Around 20 advanced to the next round. 
Round 3: Technical Interview 
This was another technical interview for 30 minutes. 
Questions were about OOP concepts, DBMS, OS. 
Two of them were output-type questions to test operator associativity and precedence. 
One coding question. The question I got was just to write a simple program to reverse a string. 
Overall harder round than the first but still relatively easy if you know the theory portions. 
Round 4 – HR 
This was a typical HR round for 5 minutes.
Two questions were asked on interest in Computer Science, goal, and motivation. 
Do not ignore this round, not everyone who got shortlisted for the HR round was selected. 
9 people were finally selected. 
TIPS: 
Start with the basics. 
Be thorough with the precedence of operator and associativity (they may vary in various programming languages, so have a basic idea of that in multiple languages). 
Do lots of coding questions on your preferred platform. 
Brush up on the company before any interview. Having a basic idea of what the company does and people at its leading positions. 
Do not cram your resume with unnecessary stuff. You must have a complete idea of the details in your resume.

2 easy-medium hacker rank questions on an online platform. 
Round 2: 
This was the first technical round. The interviewer was pretty friendly. She made sure I wasn't tensed and made me feel comfortable asking a few questions about my day. Then she went on to coding questions. It was a pretty easy question from leetcode which I had to code live. After the coding question, we had a great conversation where we asked each other questions. She asked me questions based on my resume and I was also given time to ask her any questions I had. 
Round 3: 
This was the final technical interview. The interviewer asked me questions on OOPS and I had to explain the concepts with examples. Then I was posed with questions on sorting algorithms and a few other easy technical questions. Here I was asked about my projects, I had done projects on data science and ML, and she asked me to explain a few concepts on the same topics. She also asked me about how I had used any of these skills in my daily life. So I basically had to describe a situation where I put these skills into practical use. Finally, I was given an opportunity to ask any questions to the interviewer. 
HR round: 
Here it was basic questions about my co-curricular activities that I had mentioned in my resume. Questions based on relocation were also asked. 
TIPS: 
It is very important to have a well written one page resume.

Number of rounds: 2
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Coding Round: 
Consisted of the 3 coding questions given below:
i. Given two 2-D arrays, find the longest subarray common to both
arrays.
ii. Find out the number of frogs alive on a given day based on the
average frog’s reproduction rate and their life expectancy.
iii. Given two arrays, find the minimum number of swaps required
to make the first array strictly increasing using only the elements
of the second.
Number of Candidates shortlisted: 5 (The criteria was most likely to solve at least 2 questions  completely)
Interview Rounds: 
2. Interview Rounds: The interview rounds consisted of 2 rounds, a technical round and an HR round.
i. Technical Round: The technical round began with the following 2 coding questions:
 Given a binary search tree, find the minimum path sum of all the root-to-leaf paths and, Given a 2-D array filled with 0’s and 1’s, find if it is possible to reach the end of the array passing only through the cells having value 1. As I was coding, the interviewers would also ask questions regarding the logic behind the program or whether further optimisations could be made. The coding section was followed by a theoretical round wherein several questions were asked regarding Object Oriented Programming. Some of the questions asked include: listing examples of OOP languages, stating their advantages and listing/explaining any of its principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, etc.)
ii. HR Round: The HR Round consisted of several questions, be it technical (no coding required) or  behavioural. Some of the question asked during this round are as follows:
  A General Introduction Background in Programming Technical Knowledge of OOPs (I was asked  about Multiple and Multi-Level Inheritance) Details regarding any Projects completed such as  team or individual, tech stacks used, time taken to complete, etc. With regards to a team:  Describe someone in/something about the team that inspired you, how your teammates would  describe you, your role in the team.
 Regarding yourself: General interests/hobbies, performance in school/participation in quizzes,   how  you would describe yourself, what you would if do if faced with a job that didn’t align with your interests Wrapping up: Anything you haven’t told them yet and whether there were any questions from your side.
TIPS:
 Practice competitive coding consistently. While this may vary from person to person, I found the initial coding assessments to be the hardest part of the overall procedure.
 Additionally, since questions involving OOPs are asked during every round, knowledge of OOPs theory is essential. Just coding on an OOPs language may not provide the necessary information at the basic level.
 Naturally, it also helps to stay calm and composed during the interview, both in terms of presentation and to maintain a clear frame of mind.
To a certain extent, it may also be beneficial to admit to not knowing something you aren’t sure of (for some theoretical concepts).
 Coding practice: DSA Sheets, any coding platform (I mainly used Leetcode)
 General Knowledge: Mostly GeeksforGeeks
 Additional skills (eg: App Development): Mainly YouTube, an online course may also help (from Coursera, Udemy or the like)

Coding Round: 
The coding round was held on HackerRank. It consisted of 3 DSA problems and was 100 minutes long. The problems were:
https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1527/B1 (The only change was that the given string might not have any ‘0’.)
There are 2 arrays, price, and profit, both having n non-negative integers. price[i] = price of ith stock. profit[i] = profit of ith stock. You have k days (k may be greater or smaller or equal to n). Initially, you have f funds. At the start of each day, you can buy any 1 stock, and at the start of the next day (before purchasing stock), its profit gets added to your funds (if you have f funds and buy ith stock, the next day your funds will be f + profit[i]).  You can buy each stock only once. What will be the maximum funds you can have after k days (start of (k + 1)th day)?
You are given a string. Unjumble the string to form spellings of digits (‘zero’, ‘one’, ‘two’, …., ‘nine’). Find the sum of all the digits. (Similar to: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/digits-whose-alphabetic-representations-are-jumbled-in-a-given-string/ . The only difference is in the end you have to find the sum of all digits of the number).
I think all who were able to do any 2 complete + 3rd partially were advanced (13 people).
Interview Rounds: 
Round 1 (Technical Interview, 35 min): 
The round began with a quick exchange of introductions. This was followed by a DSA coding question. A HackerRank link was given where I was asked to code. The question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sort-array-wave-form-2/. I began by explaining the approach with sorting and then I coded it. Then I was asked to optimize the code, so I started coming up with the second approach mentioned in the link and finally coded that too. After this, the interview shifted to OOPS. I was asked to write a class Book and then was asked, “If some end-user would like to search a Book in a database/list of Books, they might want to search either by price, title, or some attribute, so write a function that searches the database with the price or title.” I didn’t get the question initially and struggled in understanding what I am being asked to do, so finally the interviewer wrote in the editor, the function signature of function ‘search’ which takes price as a parameter, and asked me to write a similar function signature with parameter title. Finally, I understood and did that and gave a brief description of polymorphism and function overloading. The round ended with them asking me if I had any questions for them.
Round 2 (Technical Interview, ~45 min):
The round began with a quick exchange of introductions. I was sent a HackerRank link to a virtual whiteboard. I mentioned all the data structures taught in college, upon being asked. Then I was asked to explain the structures of Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, and Heap. After that, the interview shifted to OOPS theory. I was asked to explain what all I know about OOPS. I was able to explain compile-time polymorphism (function and operator overloading), and encapsulation. I wasn’t able to recall what data abstraction is, and couldn’t recall what the 4th feature was. After this, I was given 2 minutes to read a DSA coding question. I explained the approach to it quickly and then coded it. I was asked to run it with tests and it cleared all the test cases. Then I was asked to explain the code line by line and how it handles the corner cases. I did that. In the end, they just asked me if I knew what design patterns are to which I responded with I don’t know and again the interview ended with them asking if I had any questions for them. 
Round 3 (HR Interview, ~30min): 
This round was taken by some senior executive and was just like a general conversation. Nothing was asked about Salesforce or from the Job Description. I was asked about my family, how will I travel to college (I was at home at the time), what makes me unique, what did the pandemic teach you, give an overview of my last 2 years at college, my club (I mentioned it in resume), what advice would I give to my juniors, etc and again finally the interview ended with them asking if I had any questions for them.
Tips for Interview Rounds:
Coding round as well as the technical interview expects you to be well-versed in DSA. This includes coming up with an approach and implementing it all the way through in a time-bound manner. Strong DSA and logic-building foundations can only be built with regular practice.
You should know basic OOPS well in theory as well as implementation. So of course, you would need to know an Object – Oriented Programming Language like C++ or Java.
Think out loud. You should explain your approach to the interviewer while you are coming up with it also. You should be able to clearly and effectively communicate your logic. While practicing DSA for interview prep, think about how you would explain the answer too.
TIPS:
Topics to focus on:  DSA, OOPS
Walk the interviewer through the problem you are solving. They are interested not in just seeing whether you can solve the questions or not, but in knowing your thought process as well.
After the interviewer gives you the question, repeat the question to them, to avoid any misinterpretation. Otherwise, you might be solving some other question itself.
If you don’t know a topic taught in a later semester, you can simply say you don’t know as it has not been taught.
Be confident.

Number of rounds: 2 (Before these 2 rounds, there will be an internal shortlisting of the applicants) 
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 1
Round 1: 
It was an online test. Aptitude test ( 30 questions ) + Technical test ( 30 questions ). Test difficulty level is from easy to moderate. You should be thorough theoretically to answer the technical questions. 
Round 2: 
It was an online interview with 2-3 panel members. 
Introduction about yourself ( Try to be precise and on point ) 
Which language you are comfortable with? 
Coding question ( medium level ) - brute force approach - optimized solution - time complexities 
Questions on the project (if done) 
Questions on OS, DBMS, SQL, OOPS. (Even if you do not mention 1 them in your resume) 
What domain interests you? - Questions on that domain based on your answer. (I told AI - RPA) 
Questions on skills and hobbies you have mentioned in your resume. 
Why John Deere? 
TIPS: 
Skills you learned out of your interest apart from the curriculum gives you an upper edge. 
Do not mention the things which you don't know in your resume, because they will surely ask you about the things you have mentioned including the hobbies. Others: (Not this company, but in general) 
If you have mentioned your hobbies as something like reading, coding, and skills like time management, problem-solving, etc. 
Expect a question from each of these. What is your favorite novel and why do you like it? On which platform do you code?- answer some platform - open it and solve a problem (interviewer selects some random question). Elaborate a situation where you have managed your time properly. What is the last problem you have solved? (not a coding problem, expect a puzzle) 
If you have mentioned projects in your resume, make sure that you are thorough about what is done in the project and that you own the project.

Round 1 (Test): 
Test Round with and 2 Coding Questions. Both questions were sort of easy logical questions. 
Round 2 (Group Discussion): 
After clearing the coding round, the 14 of us were put together in a meeting to have a group discussion. The topic was ‘How the corona pandemic has affected technology?'. Each of us was asked to share our views and once everyone completed, we were asked to discuss among ourselves. Try to initiate conversation and try to add more key points. 2 were selected from this round. 
Round 3 (HR Round): 
They first asked about my location preference. I replied Bangalore. The interview was pretty resume based. I was a part of IPF technical teams and worked on developing a MUN website. I mentioned the same in my resume. So they proceeded to ask me about my experiences within the team, the challenges I faced during the process, how I overcame them, and the valuable outcomes I earned. I elaborated on these topics in a technical language. 
TIPS: 
Try not to stutter during the GD. 
Speak boldly and confidently even if what you are about to say makes zero sense.
Try to initiate conversations. 
In the HR round, try not to bluff because they come up with questions that really test the integrity of the things that you claim to possess

2. The interviewer asked a couple of DSA and OOPS questions, and had me code my solutions live.
3. A puzzle about gambling was also posed. Overall, the interviewer was friendly and made me feel comfortable.
TIPS: 
Do as many DSA problems as possible. Also, go through some popular puzzles towards the end of your preparation. One good resource for puzzles is GFG, which has a large collection of puzzles. Even if you already know the answer to a puzzle, it's a good idea to take your time to act dumb and show ur thought process rather than jumping to the answer.

Number of rounds: 2
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 1
Round 1 : (Coding)
This round mainly comprised of coding and some aptitude tests. 
There were two questions that were asked in the coding section. 
I don’t exactly remember the questions but the two questions were similar to medium difficulty questions found in Leetcode and GFG.
Round 2: (Technical Interview)
This round was a technical interview where the interviewer mainly inquired about topics that were mentioned in the resume.
I was asked some basic questions on OOPS (like polymorphism, 4 pillars of OOPS, etc.)
I was also asked about Web Development, like the frameworks that I use. (I had mentioned it in my resume)
Some basic understanding of front-end and backend will be helpful if you have any projects related to Web Development.
Round 3: (HR Round)
It was an HR round. It was done via a telephone call. 
I was mainly inquired about my family background, hobbies, etc. I was told about the possible locations of the internship and my final stipend. No other major questions were asked. All students that were selected for the HR round were selected for the internship.
TIPS:
Try to give an answer confidently even if you may feel doubtful during the interview, as it may leave a positive impression on the interviewer.
Please be thorough on whatever is mentioned in your resume even if it is a very small project.

 Stipend: 75,000 Rs
Number of rounds: 4
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1 (Online Test): 
    This round was conducted on Hackerearth coding platform. The test was for 2 hrs and had 10 MCQs
    and 2 coding questions. The MCQs were based on OS, DBMS, DSA and Computer networking. The coding 
    questions were of medium difficulty level.
    The first question was similar to gfg next greater element and the second one was query and 
    bit manipulation based.
    I solved only one coding question full and attempted all the MCQs.
    15 people were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2 (Technical Interview): 
This round began with the interviewer asking me to introduce myself. 
After that, he gave me a situation analysis-based question. 
You have a safe house and n spies. You are surrounded by n enemy camps. You have to send one spy to 
each enemy camp. How will you represent this considering each enemy camp as a node? Now suppose you
have only one spy what will you do? Give real life examples of n-ary tree and binary tree.
He asked me the time complexities for every answer I told. For this, you need to be thorough with graph and tree data structures.
 Then he asked me about graph traversals, their differences, where they are used, and their time complexities. 
For this, you have to be thorough with basic graph traversal concepts.
    Then he went on to ask me about sorting algorithms. He asked me which sorting algo was the best and explain 
    why. Then he asked me to explain merge sort with an example explaining each step in a notepad/any IDE.
    I used VScode for this round. After that he asked me to explain and write the code for bubble sort and after that          explain bubble sort with the same example as that given for the merge sort.
  After that, he started asking me about heap sort and heapify. I told them I couldn't remember everything about  because I never got to use it that much but he was fine with that.
    Then he asked about my interest. (In my previous interviews in another company, I mentioned in my resume that 
    my areas of interest where AI, ML and web dev and so my interviewer asked me in depth questions about ML and        AI but I couldnt answer them because I just knew the basics of AI and ML and told him that I am yet to explore
these areas. He said that if you mention your interests in your resume it is for sure that the person interviewing you will ask questions based on that and that you should be able to deal with whatever is thrown your way. So for this  interview, I removed the interests section from my resume.) I told him this. So he didnt dive deep into those areas.
    
He then gave me a coding question. You are given an array 1 2 3 4 5 5 and the target sum is 10 find all the  subarrays with target sum as the sum of the subarray. I first gave a brute force O(n^2) solution but he asked me to optimize it applying various constraints he told. Finally I got the optimal solution of O(n) (sliding window) with certain constraints that he told me to apply. He also asked me to give another solution for which I gave an O(nlogn) method. He was satisfied with all my answers.
        
He gave me another coding question. Given an array 1 5 -1 7 find the number of pairs with sum equal to 6. I gave an O(n) solution making use of hashset. He was satisfied with that as well.
Then he gave three strings cat, tca, act and asked me whats common to them. Come up with an algorithm such that if he gives me cta and atc then those strings should be identified as valid. This question is similar to the Valid 
    Anagram question in leetcode.
    I came up with 2 solutions for this question and told the time and space complexities for them as well.
    He asked me whether I had any doubts or questions for him. I asked him about his role when he joined DB and his
current role.
    This round took around 45 to 50 mins to finish.
    After this round 9 people were shortlisted for the next round.
    
Round 3 (Professional fitment):
The interviewer was the same guy who gave the Pre placement talk. He asked me to give an introduction without mentioning the things I have written in my resume. Then he gave me a coding question to reverse a string meaningfully. Example: "my name is xyz"
    The output should be "xyz is name my".
    I gave a python one liner solution but he asked me to write the code in C as well. So before starting
    the coding part I told him each detail of the solution that I was going to code. He was satisfied with 
    the explanation itself and therefore told me not to code.
Then he went on to ask me about my project and why I did only one project. My project included OOPS concepts.
    So he began asking questions from OOPS.
    He asked me the difference between data structures and algorithms and some basic DSAtheory questions.
    He then asked whether I attended any previous interviews and why I couldn't crack those interview rounds.
    Then he asked me about my extra-curricular activities and the courses that I mentioned in my resume.
    He asked me whether I had any doubts or questions for him. I asked about his job role and experience.
(He had already covered this in the PPT but because of the internet issue I couldn't hear it. So attend the PPT thoroughly and take screenshots if necessary.)
    I also asked him to explain the projects that I will get to work on if I join their internship team.
    This round took around 20 mins to finish.
    After this round, 6 people were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 4 (HR):
    The interviewer was super chill and I instantly got a positive vibe from her. 
She asked me how my previous rounds went and whether I remember the names of the interviewers. I knew the full names of both my interviewers which impressed her. She then asked me why I chose DB. I told her that after attending the ppt it was clear to me that my interests and the company's interest match and that would help me to excel in my career. I also mentioned that I would get a lot of exposure by working on AI, ML-based projects (they mentioned these in the PPT) during the internship period.
    So she asked me that if they don't give me projects based on my interest will I still be open to working with 
DB? I told her that since I am a fresher, I can never demand the firm to give me a project based on what I want.
     I said that I was open to all possibilities.
She asked whether I have heard about DB before this and whether I bothered to google about it. I told her that I came to know about DB when I was going through the interview diaries of NITC and that I knew the CEOs name and the year in which DB was founded. She then asked about my hobbies and my extra-curricular activities and how I stayed positive throughout the covid period. She asked me about which DB value I liked the most and why. She also asked whether I could recollect all the DB values. (The DB values were mentioned in the PPT.) Then she asked me which value I implement the most in my daily life and why. She was very engaging and wanted to know more about me.
    This round took around 15 mins to finish.
    Finally, 5 people were selected for the internship.
    
TIPS:
Remember even if you don't get the solution don't remain silent. Ask the interviewer for more details and test cases.
if necessary. 
Try to describe what you are going to do before you start coding the solution.
Go through the ppt and take screenshots so that you can go through them before the interviews.
Have proper knowledge about the company and its policies. 
Be confident and believe in yourself.

Round 1: 
The online round consisted of 10 MCQ questions on OOPS, OS, DBMS and Networking and 2 coding questions. 
Round 2: 
Firstly, they ask us to introduce ourselves and tell something about ourselves. Basically, the first round was based on our resume. I had a Python project in my resume and I was asked questions about it. Then he asked about the x and o game. Then I was asked about reversing a linked list and binary search. Be careful about what you are putting in your resume because it changes the questions they ask. 
Round 3: 
Round 2 was a more chill and pro-fit round. I had put a competition which I had participated in with my team of 3 people, so the interviewer mainly asked about that and here also they asked me about my project. So thorough information about the project is necessary. 
Round 4: 
This was the HR round. Here the interviewer wanted to know about my attitude and what I knew about Deutsche bank. Here they asked about what we remember from the PPT, which location we prefer etc

Total 22 students got shortlisted for the interviews.
 
Round 2 (Coding Interview - Duration: 1 hr 30 min):
The interview happened on the Hackerrank website. The interviewer introduced himself and asked for my introduction. He gave 2 coding questions.
Q1. Similar to the same question in the online test to cross-check the originality in the online test: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-subarray-not-k-distinct-elements/
I could solve this question as it was similar to the question that I got in the online test and explained the approach, along with time, and space complexities and passed all test cases in a single run.
 
Q2. Similar to https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-subarrays-having-an-equal-count-of-0s-and-1s-segregated/
After looking at the question, I could not even understand the question. He was cool and asked me to explain the question to him first. I explained it to him by taking sample test cases and I was struck with a naive approach. As the time was running short, he gave me hints to solve the question with an efficient approach. He was checking my ability to approach the problem and the underlying pattern to solve the problem. After many hints, I concluded the approach, implemented it, and passed 2 test cases. He interrupted in between and told me to reduce the complexity by giving another hint. I implemented it in 2 minutes and ran all test cases. He asked me if I had any questions to ask him. I asked about his experience at cashfree and opportunities for the freshers. 
Total of 10 students got shortlisted for the next round.
 
Round 3 (CS Fundamentals - Duration 1hr):
The interview happened on the Hackerrank website. The interviewer introduced himself and confirmed whether I am comfortable with CS fundamentals. After my introduction, he asked me to explain the TCP/IP model, by writing each of the layers and its functionalities on the Hackerank text editor. This discussion lasted for 20 minutes and he asked the difference between TCP and UDP, DNS, HTTP and HTTPS. He then gave a SQL query to print employee id, count their commits and non-commits (work row contains: commit(1), non-commits(0)) for each employee in ascending order from a given table which contains more rows for each employee id. The question is similar to: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mysql-query-to-count-the-number-of-0s-and-1s-from-a-table-column-and-display-them-in-two-columns
I explained the query and my approach first. Then I coded the query and passed all test cases in a single run.
After that, he gave a question from page replacement algorithms similar to: https://mycareerwise.com/content/gate-question-on-lru/content/exam/gate/computer-science
Before solving the question, he asked me to explain cache and other related algorithms. He asked me to draw the frames table and explain each step to determine the number of page faults.
He gave me another question from scheduling algorithms which is similar to: https://examradar.com/shortest-job-first-sjf-scheduling-algorithms-questions-answers/
Before solving the above question, he asked me to explain the types of scheduling algorithms, the difference between preemption and non-preemption and fill the table by calculating CT, TAT, WT, AVG WT.
Next, he asked me to explain and write the steps when we type “www.google.com” in a web browser.
He concluded and asked me if I had any questions to ask him. I asked him about the current projects in which they are working on and the technologies to learn for the role. 
Total of 7 students got shortlisted for the next round.
 
Round 4 (Managerial - Duration: 30min):
The interview happened on Google Meet. The interviewer introduced himself and told me about the current projects he was leading and the projects he had handled at the company. He asked me to introduce myself and explain about my projects. I was asked about the overall idea and asked why I used MySQL for the database. He also asked me the difference between no SQL and SQL, C and CPP. He then asked my favorite subject from the curriculum and why did I choose that as my favorite subject. He also asked me why we need the implementation of graph algorithms in the curriculum and asked me to explain the current applications behind them. 
Total of 4 students got selected for the final round.

AUTHOR : NIHAL E
Stipend: 98,000 per month 
Number of rounds: 4
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1: Test round
 
I remember around 40 questions in total. 38 being MCQ and 2 are coding questions. Don’t attend the coding questions unless you complete the MCQs because they carry more weight than the coding questions. MCQs are based on Networking. Have a basic knowledge of network classes, IP addresses, sockets, etc. Coding will be tough and if you are using C, it will take a whole lot of your time. It is better to print some output and get partial marks rather than just avoiding the whole question. It worked for me. 
I knew the answer and knew it would take at least one hour to completely code out the solution. So I simply printed a few outputs and got a few test cases passed. Something’s better than nothing.
Round 2: Technical round
An engineer from Cisco would ask you some coding questions and mostly it would be based on pointer-based data structures ( singly-linked lists and binary trees mostly ). We would use Notepad or some other app to demonstrate our thoughts in the form of pseudocode. 
Don’t be silent on the outside. Tell them the way you think the code could work even if it is wrong. They would often give some hints and help you. Following indentation practices are well appreciated. 
My interviewer was a guy named Manish from Bangalore and he was quite chill and made my day. So, if you get an interviewer who is almost your age it’d be great. 
I got 3 questions.
1.  Find the joining point of 2 singly-linked lists. (At some point, they have the same nodes till the end, like a y-tube ). Traverse to the end to find the size and make both equally sized. Now, traverse simultaneously until both pointers are the same.
2.     Reverse a singly linked list ( this is a standard problem ).
3.     Vertically mirror a binary tree ( Use recursive algorithm and change left and right pointers ).
Round 3: Managerial round
He would know your personality, communication fluency, and group participation skills (Try to come up with some work you did during Ragam or Tathva or Club programs). 
Share your experience from the previous round and some good points about Cisco. Don’t use filler sounds like “Aah” in between. Try reducing that. He would ask which field we are interested in and questions somewhat related. He would ask about classes and inheritance, so it is better to know some basics rather than nothing. Don’t be shy to tell him that you haven’t practically used classes much and why. Communication and group involvement are the main key points they are checking.
Round 4: HR round
This would be the HR head and he would most probably be tired because he would just go on with the same questionnaire and fill in the necessary details over and over again for all. Why Cisco? Who is its competitor? (It’s Juniper) What are the products of Cisco? What have you heard about Cisco? (Boast about the no.1 work-life balance thing somewhat and some recent news like the CEO changed to Mr.Chuck ).
I am interning at Cisco currently and it’s Day 2. Everyone is way more friendly than we expected. Formality is something they hate. They like to be more casual, but the work they do is great. Work would get in between our joyous journey, but they enjoy around 80% of their life. Only 20% of your day would be work, and the salary is good too. Try to be friendly with the interviewer and don’t be over-formal. 
They mostly hate it. 
So, chill and be prepared, especially to communicate properly in a semi-formal manner.

CISCO: TECHNICAL UNDERGRADUATE INTERN
AUTHOR : UDAMALA UDAY
Stipend: 98,000 per month 
Number of rounds: 4
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
The online test was about an hour and a half. There were a few aptitude-based questions, some networking questions, and ended with 2 coding problems.  Go through the basics of networking to prepare for this. The two coding questions are of medium level. 
 
Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW
This round was completely technical. It was a one-on-one interview. This round was about 1 hour. The interviewer was not intimidating and it helped reduce stress a lot. He started off easy; the first question was based on storage classes and the types of storage classes and continued to ask some questions on data structures.  Then he moved on to a coding question based on linked list, a simple one and asked me to run that code on a compiler. He gave me enough time to type out the solution. The second question was about removing all occurrences of a character in a given input string. For the third question, he just asked me to write a pseudo algorithm for a double-linked list-based question.
 
Round 3: SECOND INTERVIEW
This round was mostly managerial with a bit of HR towards the end, again one on one. It started off with him asking me about the projects. This is an important aspect of the interview. But I didn’t have one on my resume. I made sure he knew the reason for this. So make sure that u have one on your resume so that u can kill time by explaining your project. Don’t choose a very complex one, it should be easy to explain it. He didn’t try to see what I knew but tried to see how interested I am in learning new things. He gave me a few scenario’s in the workplace and asked me how would you respond in this given scenario. The interviewer shared his experiences working with the company and that concluded the second part of the interview.
 
Round 4: FINAL INTERVIEW
This round was almost totally HR, a final wrap-up. He asked me why I would want to join CISCO and Who are the big competitors of CISCO. He asked me about the location preference. It was quite chill overall, just needed to be enterprising and confident. That marked the end of the process. The results were announced later that night.
 
 
 
 
Tips:
Keep coding throughout the vacation, one or two problems a day from Hackerrank or Leetcode.
Ensure that you have a project mentioned on your resume.
Prepare the basics of networking.
Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it.
Do some research about the company and its motto before going to the interview.
 
 
Others: 
Don’t despair if you don’t get called for a long time. For me, the second round concluded at around 1 pm and had to wait until 7:30 pm for the last round ( a very long 6 hrs gap). Just relax and keep calm. Don’t lose faith when you don’t qualify for the round but keep giving your best for every chance you have got (luck also plays an important factor).

Mainly concentrated on the Networking part, basic and logical math, OOPS, and DBMS (basics)
Coding – 2 questions on graphs
 
Round 2:
Introduction and basics of C++ (mainly OOPS) Reverse a Linked List
Zig-Zag traversal of graphs
 
Round 3:
Discussed briefly about my resume. He mainly concentrated on the projects mentioned in my resume. He asked me about my interests and my answer was A.I., then we debated on the development and utilization of A.I.
 
Round 4:
A brief Introduction of myself What do you know about Cisco? 
Why do you prefer Cisco over other organizations? What are Cisco's Competitors? 
Where will you stand in the company after 5 years?
TIPS: 
Be confident with what you know, even if you do not know the answer, tell them that you will research it later.
Try to have an open debate with the interviewer, more interaction more possibilities to impress him.
Concentrating on the company's details, its products, and the ranks it attained in various rankings, may be helpful in the HR round.
It’s always better to say that you plan to be present in the company for a long time.

Number of rounds: 4  Selected: 8 (25 passed the coding Round)
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3

Round 1:
The test round consisted of 42 questions which comprised Aptitude questions, Networking based questions and some from OOPs, OS and DBMS. 2 Coding questions based on graphs which were hard and I only managed to solve them partially. (I don’t think anyone solved those questions completely)
 
Round 2:
In the first round of interview, the interviewer was a friendly guy. He started by asking some basic C++ questions (like different types of data types and all) as I mentioned in my resume.
Then he proceeded to ask a few DSA questions which is usual in every interview. I didn’t remember all the questions he asked but one of the questions was to find the longest palindromic substring. It would be better if we first solve the question in the interview with a brute force approach and then try to optimize it further. Also while solving the questions, it is important to speak out what you are thinking and how you are approaching the solution to the interviewer.
Then he asked some puzzles and at the end he asked me to explain and implement AVL tree. I was surprised that usually such advanced DSA question don’t used to be asked in the interview. I explained to him what is AVL tree and how it works and given the pseudo code and also tried to code for one of the cases of AVL tree and he was satisfied with my answer.
 
Round 3:
It was basically the HR and Managerial round, he asked some questions based on what I had mentioned in my resume and there was a long discussion on my project.
The questions were not focused on the implementation part, rather he asked me about the difficulties I have faced while doing my project and what improvements/changes could have improved the overall project.
 
Round 4:
It was also a HR round but nothing much happened. He asked some common HR questions like ‘Why do you want to join Cisco ?’ , ‘Where do you see yourself in next 5 years ?’, ‘Biggest competitor of Cisco’ and in the end he asked about the preferred location.
 
TIPS: 
For interviews, in the beginning, you should introduce yourself and it shouldn’t be too short or too long just precise enough so that the interviewer will get an idea about you and in the end, it would be better if you ask some questions to the interviewer like ‘his/her experience in that firm’ or ‘his/her role in the firm’
It would be better if you have one solid project in your resume, but I didn’t have any such project and only mentioned my club website to which I contributed only some frontend elements. Anyway, it was not a problem for me as Cisco didn’t focus much on projects. 
Never lose hope and it is never too late to start. I started my preparation at the end of July when companies started visiting our campus and at first, I also thought it was too late to start preparing for the interview and I would not be able to crack any company. Then I just kept these negative thoughts aside and started preparing for it and in the end, it was worth it. Even if you haven’t done anything in the past 2 years, still you can manage to grab a good offer. 
I recommend you to focus on DSA and just theory but also on problem solving as it plays a key role in your interviews

ROUND 1: ONLINE TEST
 The online test had questions based on graphs and also some basic networking questions.
ROUND 2: CODING ROUND
I was asked a modified version of the binary search question from Leetcode (I don't remember the exact question). The interviewer then asked me about my project and some basic ReactJS questions (My project was made using ReactJS). 
ROUND 3: INTERVIEW WITH MANAGER
He asked me about the things I had mentioned in my resume; he just wanted to verify if the experiences were legit or not. He was very friendly and gave me a few pieces of advice.
ROUND 4: HR ROUND
The interviewer asked about my goals and if I had any plans for further studies. I was asked some questions to check if I knew the company well enough; one was about a very recent program they started with the Government of India.
TIPS:
Be confident.
If you don't know the topic tell them so that they don't ask further questions.

Number of rounds: 4  
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:
Test Round with some aptitude (Networking / DBMS / OOPS questions can be expected) and 2 coding questions. Both are based on graphs (Hard) (The question was about adding modems to the office building and other buildings, it's about the least number of modems). I have yet to find anyone to solve either of the questions. I managed to make some test cases pass. For me, 5 test cases passed on both questions, which helped me to qualify for the upcoming rounds.
Round 2:
First Interview Round. He asked several short questions based on DSA and one puzzle. (To find one ball with different weights among many balls with the least amount of tries with weight balance). He also asked which Data Structure is used for Dictionary (Tries). He asked me to code the search algorithm in BST and BT. (He was friendly compared to others from different company interviews).
They asked me to explain any of my projects. I did, and he didn't care much about them(projects).
The Round went well. I asked him about 5G and Cisco's scope (google “Cisco news” to ask something relevant). He told me to ask HR. I requested Tips for further rounds to which he replied "That's not how it works", and wished me luck.
Round 3:
●   HR Round, The HR manager asked so many personal questions, like where do you see yourself in 5 years(Senior engineer at Cisco), ambition, goal in life(parents), and why Cisco? , products from Cisco (some modems from their website and packet tracer), Competition (Junipher, AWS, ZOOM), and some questions like "Hardest point in your life" and "Experiences in overcoming difficult situations in your life". I made up some stories spot-on and impressed him. He also asked about planning for further studies. ( I answered, "In CSE, I don't think there is a need for a master, technology keeps changing. We just need to keep up")
●   He then asked about networks, and asked me to explain TCP and its 3-way Handshaking.
●   I asked him about the COVID situation and how employees at Cisco overcame it. (online, work, home, and other craps)
Round 4: 
Nothing Much. Asked me about your interview experience. Is this your first interview? (6th company for me).
He asked about the preferred location. And That's it. 
TIPS:
●   C won't help you.
●   DSA is not required to pass the coding round. It helps in an interview.
●   Learn C++ + STL (Standard Template Library) to solve questions if you are familiar with C.
●   Else stick with Python.
●   Neetcode.io solve easy and medium-type questions from this, at least.
●   Many of your Friends won't care about this drive and will eventually lose interest after failing some tests. Don't be that guy. Work hard so that you can secure an internship at a good company and relax for the next two years.
●   (After August/September, good companies will pop up rarely, and the drive will be dry with so many small companies with low stipends, but some companies, like Barclays, came up with a 1 lakh Stipend during December, so it depends on your luck )
●   Learn some basics about Networks and DBMS.
●   Some companies won't give a crap about Projects, while others focus too much on them. Cisco didn't focus much on Projects. So it's always good to have 1 or 2 solid projects. (Companies like Goldman will concentrate on subjects if you don't have any projects, which will make the easy interview more difficult)
●   After each interview round, be prepared with a Question. Google companies name and go to the news tab; you can find relevant info to ask about.

Round 1:
First one was based on System design and writing api calls in Javascript or TypeScript
The other two DSA questions are as mentioned below
1.Maximum Distance between Frogs
There are n blocks, numbered from 0 to n-1, arranged in a row. a couple of frogs were
sitting together on one block when they had a terrible quarrel. now they want to jump away
from one another so that the distance between them will be as large as possible. the
distance between blocks numbered j and k, where j ≤ k, is computed as k − j 1. the frogs
can only jump up, meaning that they can move from one block to another only if the two
blocks are adjacent and the second block is of the same or greater height as the first. what
is the longest distance that they can possibly create between each other, if they also chose
to sit on the optimal starting block initially?
2.https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-of-subarrays-with-average-k/
I could solve the two DSA questions but not the first one.
People selected-7
Round 2 :
Interview.
Mode-Online
Duration-45-50 minutes
It started off with exchange of basic greetings and there were 2 interviewers in the panel .
They tried to make me comfortable. Then I was asked to introduce myself . I specifically asked them if they’d like me to share my screen and go point by point on my resume or explain in general . They were fine with any , I chose to share my screen so nothing gets missed. When it came to projects they
asked me to explain them in detail . I had my GitHub opened already in the next tab and I
explained both my projects to them. While explaining my initial web development project , the asked my if I knew SQL and implemented in the project to which my answer was No . Then they asked me if I knew what HA was in web dev and I again replied with a No . Then I was asked if this project is
hosted to which my answer was once again No. After three No’s they asked me more about the functionality of my part and since the code was in Flask I, was asked about Python and the SMTP protocol which I had implemented. I could answer those questions. I tried to direct the interview towards AI because I was better versed with it also knew the functionalities better.
So they asked me about my chatbot which is meant to write cover letters for you when you
give it your resume. They asked me about the implementation , code , API calls all of
which I could answer.
Then I was asked to open the online IDE for some DSA.
After making me comfortable with the IDE , I was asked a question to find a height of the
binary tree . I used the notepad to represent a tree and went step by step .(This was an advice by one
of my seniors and it did help me explain better since there was no pen and paper).
Then I had to code the same and questions on time complexity were asked. Then they asked me about finding the diameter of the tree. I explained the brute force method first and then discussed optimisations . They were satisfied with my response so didn’t ask me to code it.
Then a few questions about my interests, volunteering , and other activities were
discussed. Then questions like Why would you like to join Amex and What do you know
about Amex were asked. Since my core interests and projects were AI and ML related I was asked what if I dont get the same field to which my response was that I am always open to work and learn new domains.
The interviewers in the end asked basic teamwork related questions and in the end asked
me if I had any questions for them to which I asked about their experience in the company
and the services they work on.
The interview ended on a light note.
5 people got a call for the next round
 Round 3:
    7 minutes after my first round ended , I got a call for the next round. This time it was just
one interviewer. I introduced myself again in a similar fashion as before . He asked me about my project
and was interested in my AI project more which he said we’d discuss later.
Then I was given this puzzle
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-22-maximum-chocolates/
I explained the answer correctly and then he asked me to code the same .
He asked me about the languages I code in and then about my proficiency in them . There
was a discussion on stacks and queues for a brief period and how many stacks would be
needed to implement a queue.Then we moved to my project which I explained to him.
he asked me if I knew how Chat GPT was trained and how it worked . I explained to him
about RLHF reinforcement learning from human feedback and GPT models.
Later there was continuous questioning on Tokenisers then transformers from which we
moved to GANs and Transformers. Later he asked me about the implementation of
Encoders in general all revolving and based on the answers I had given to him.
Then he asked me if I had any questions for him , I said I had two . I asked him if I’d get to
work in the Data centre in Bangalore (so that I could portray that I knew how the company
works in AI and its applications).
The second question I asked was about his experience and domain and he said he has
been working in building AI services since the last 5 years.
Finally the interview ended after around 35 minutes.
 
TIPS: 
The platform used by Amex is its own platform which does not allow you to see whether
your code passes the hidden test cases or not. Your code gets evaluated only after you
submit the code. Once you submit a question you can’t modify it .
Try to efficiently analyse time complexity and space complexity since the brute force code
might pass the sample cases but not the hidden ones.
Don’t get nervous if you dont know an answer or concept , it is completely fine to be honest about what you know .
Be well versed with your projects and have at least one individual project
Always let the interviewer know what you are thinking , start building the code from scratch, give the brute force solution and then optimise it
You can decide the direction of the interview so make sure you know your strong and weak
points.

Number of rounds: 3
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 2
Round 1 - Coding test
The primary screening test had 2 coding-related questions. It had a debugging question also.
Round 2 - HR-Coding interview
It was a single panelist interview.
 
1.     The interview began with introductory questions such as a personal introduction and further questions were based on it. Questions included my coding experience, projects done and concepts, languages interested in, and my future plans.
2.     Inheritance and data encapsulation-related questions were asked.
3.     An array-based question was given on balancing parentheses.
I made a mistake in pasting the question from the Google Meet and went on with it. After carefully explaining my coding process, she prompted me to review my work, enabling me to identify and rectify the error on the spot. At that moment, it felt like I had lost because of that mistake, and there was no talk of any other rounds or chances.
 
Round 3 - HR Technical Interview
It was again a single interviewer. The interview had been arranged at the last moment and the SPOCS had to call me to inform me that the interviewer was waiting for me to join. I had just filled my plate at the mess when I got the call. It was all panic and rush to open my laptop.
1.     One question pertained to optimizing search on an array of 1000 objects, while another addressed the same task but with only 10 objects. (Binary search vs Linear search, Time complexity)
2.     The final question "Why Amex? "
This interview concluded in less than 10 mins. They were also rushing to conclude the interview. 
Do read up on the company before you sit for the interview. Just basic know-how on the various employee policies of the company, how it started, current position, and its motto. (They want to know what aspect of the company made you sit for this interview and not just for the perks of an internship).
 
TIPS:
 Online interviews require good interaction during the interview. 
In case they do not start a conversation, take the initiative to randomly ask a question. Do know every detail mentioned in the resume.
Also, the major concepts dealt with in your project.

Round 1:
It was a technical round.
He asked me about my coding skills and how well I could code. He then started asking me coding questions. He asked about my favorite coding problem and asked me to solve the problem in my own style and then elaborated on the question more.
He also gave me a coding problem and asked me to solve it. (They will assist you in solving the problem, ask for hints)
Stay honest in the interview. If you don’t know the answer just tell them (no worries), and they will help you out. Don't be nervous during the interview.
Round 2 :
It was an HR round.
He asked me many questions related to personal experiences, challenges I faced, etc.
Be prepared for the HR questions and be honest and mindful while answering those kinds of questions.
 
TIPS: 
Don’t be nervous before and during the interview. Prepare your mind beforehand and don't feel bad if rejected ("I, too, experienced the setback of being rejected during the Cisco interview."). Stay motivated.
Prepare a short introduction that can impact your interview phase (The first impression is the best impression)
Prepare Data Structures(Stack, Queue, Linked lists also their examples) well before the interview.

SYSTEMS INTERN 
AUTHOR : ARITRO GHOSH
Stipend: Rs 1,50,000 
Number of Rounds: 1 (coding +MCQ ) round and 3 interview rounds
Round 1 (Coding + MCQ Round):
There were 26 questions split into 4 sections.The first section was Computer Fundamentals covering topics like OOPS, Computer Networks, DBMS, and Operating Systems. (In descending order of priority).
 The second section contained aptitude and math-based questions like speed-time or work-time problems.
 The third section contained system design questions covering topics like CORS, DBMS, etc
 The fourth section was a single coding question - Find the number of new arrays you can generate for a given array such that for each 1 <= new_arr[i] <= arr[i] and no number is repeated in the new array. (Easy implementation with medium intuition)
16 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2 (Technical Interview):
This was the first technical round that happened in person. They started by asking me to choose my most important project. I chose one and had to describe it thoroughly. They cross-questioned me based on it. Then they asked me a question based on OOPS and function overriding. Lastly, they asked me a few questions based on Python Interpreters, C/C++ compilers, and Memory management in both languages. I could answer most of them
but not to a proper extent. They would always guide me to the answer they wanted by adding more to the question but would not confirm if I got it correctly. They ended by asking if I wanted to ask a question. I asked how much financial knowledge would be needed to work in the development team of a Fin-Tech company.
Round 3 (HR Round):
This happened immediately after the first technical round. I was asked about my personal aspirations, family life, goals, where I see myself in a few years, and why I want to join the company. The conversation flowed well and there were no difficult questions in this round. She asked me if I had any questions and I asked what opportunities there are as an intern in DE Shaw and what are some things to look out for.
6 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 4 (Technical Interview II):
This was the last round and it took well over an hour for me. They started by asking me to introduce myself. Then they went on to ask me about some DSA algorithms. They asked me which topic was my forte to which I replied with graphs. Then they started asking me which algorithms specifically. So, I described one or two graph algorithms that I had a good grasp over. I explained Kahn’s Algorithm. Then they asked me a question combining MST, shortest path, and computer networks. I was able to come up with a vague solution but nothing
concrete. Then they asked me a few questions based on Kadane’s Algorithm and made me modify it to serve more functionalities. Finally, they asked me to solve some puzzles from GFG. The North-South Pole puzzle was asked. They asked if I had any questions but I was out of questions so I just asked a similar question as the HR round about what to look out for.
Tips:
Solve tons of Leetcode medium-level questions. If you are starting early you can also do some Codeforces or Codechef.
Make sure to learn computer fundamentals properly and know keywords and terms.
While using libraries or modules make sure to have an idea behind their implementations.
If you don’t know the answer to a question, don’t fret to say that.
Speak out all your thoughts openly and make sure to be polite.

Coding Round
The coding test was held on HackerEarth. It consisted of three questions. I believe there was a question based on arrays (sliding window), a question based on topological sort (similar to  https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule- ii/description/), and a question based on trees (find the maximum number of edges you can remove such that sum of node values in each connected component is same). I did the arrays question and topological sort question.
Interview Round 1 (Technical)
Interviews were held on Google Meet. I was shared a Google doc where I had to write pseudocode for questions asked. The following two questions were asked:
https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/
 https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-ii/
I was then asked to solve a given puzzle. However, I couldn’t do it. 
Lastly, I was given a problem based on dynamic programming in a 2D grid. I was able to explain the basic idea to the interviewer. Due to time constraints, I was not asked to code it.
 
Interview Round 2 (Technical)
I do not recall much from this interview, but I was asked questions based on linked lists, binary trees (similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/), and arrays. I was asked a question based on semaphores in operating systems. However, I had not studied this topic then and told the interviewer that I would be learning it in the upcoming semesters.
 
Interview Round 3 (Technical)
The interviewer asked me to tell him “My story”. He then asked me why the company was named Sprinklr. I had a vague idea of this, but I couldn't explain it to him, so he explained it to me. I was asked why I want to work at Sprinklr, what my favorite company was etc. I was also asked what I knew about cloud computing which I answered vaguely. I was just honest in this round. In retrospect, I might have been too honest and said some things other interviewers would have rejected me for. Nevertheless, he appreciated my honesty, and I got through :)
Tips
Practice a lot of DSA problems, especially on arrays and dynamic programming. Always try to start from a naïve or brute force approach and optimise your solution. Also, go through a few puzzles.

Round 1: ( Online Test Round )
This was an Online Test. It consisted of 3 questions each weighted differently. One question was on trees (which was hard). One was on graphs and another on arrays. I answered two of them which was enough to get me to the next round. If you are good with DSA I think you will find it easy. 
Round 2 : ( Interview Round )
This was the first interview round I had. The interviewer was very kind and was ready to be helpful. He introduced himself and then asked me to introduce myself. In this round, I had to answer 3 DSA Questions. 1 on the array and the other two on DP. For the first one, I had to write the code in docs. Then I had to run the code in my environment with some input that he gave. Throughout the interview, I was asked to describe my thought process. Then he gave me the 2nd question for which I had the brute force algorithm and was kind of struck then he gave me a hint. Then I was able to answer that too. Then the 3rd was kind of tough but I was able to think through it quickly. Then he asked me about the complexity of my solution and asked me to reason about its correctness. I only had to implement solutions for the first 2. For the third one, he was convinced by my reasoning and said “No need to code it”.
In the interview when I was running my code in my local environment he saw I was using Vim. And at the time I didn’t know the concept of registers in Vim. He explained to me about global registers + and *.  And at the end of the interview asked if there was anything I would like to ask. I think I asked something but I don’t quite remember.
 
Round 3 : ( Interview Round )
It started the same way. With greetings and introduction. Then I was asked to implement Hash Tables in C. I did it quickly. Then he went to ask me about the project in my resume and wanted to walk me through it. It was a project on text compression using Huffman encoding. At first, I started explaining, and mid-way through I thought I could do better so I asked him if he could share a jam-board. He was happy to share it then I started to explain it on the jam board then went on and ran through a small example. Then He asked me what my interests were, at the time I was interested in learning Neural Networks. So I explained why I was interested in them. I was good in theory for Neural Networks because of MIT lectures and 3b1b videos. So I told him everything I knew and also told him what I wasn’t too sure of. Then He asked me if I had any questions for him. I asked him What will I be expected to work on if I got selected. Then he answered it. 
Round 4: ( HR INTERVIEW ROUND )
This Round was not a technical round. First, she introduced herself and asked to tell me about myself which was not already on my resume. Then she asked me about my interests, Hobbies. I replied that I’m interested in watching anime, critiquing anime, listening to music etc. And then she went on to ask me about my weakness. To which I replied that talking to people was not my stronghold but I’m better at it now. Then she asked me why I think I’m getting better. Then she went on to ask me about how I wanted my career to look even if I was not with sprinklr. Then she asked me what I thought my strength was. I answered that I will never fool myself into thinking I understand something which I don’t. Then she asked me whether I prefer the backend or frontend development. Then she asked me if I had any questions. I asked some cliche questions which I don’t quite remember. 
TIPS:
●   Prepare well. Practice problems on sites like leetcode, and geeksforgeeks. Attempt contests regularly this will help you be able to solve them in time.
●   Don’t get discouraged if you fail the interviews. You just have to try again in the next test.
●   Be Confident in the interviews. Have a deep breath if you think you are rushing. Pace yourself well in the interview.
●   Be honest if you don’t know stuff. They will change the topic for you.
●   Prepare for cliche questions.
●   If you have done enough DSA. Then write a good Project. And know your project inside out. It’s good to have 2-3 good projects.
●   I didn’t get any questions on OOPs in this interview but you should prepare concepts in OOPs as it is a major topic on which they ask questions.

GOLDMAN SACHS: INTERNSHIP (SUMMER ANALYST) 
AUTHOR : Arjun Krishna M S
Round 1 (Online assessment)
The test was conducted online on hackerrank
The test consisted of 2 coding questions and 12 MCQs. Each question had equal weightage.
The coding questions were graph related. One of them was a simple question to find the number of connections each node has in an undirected graph. The other one was on finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. I’m attaching the link to a similar question on leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-genetic-mutation/
The MCQs were mostly based on DSA, OOPs and OS .OOPs questions were in java.There were some aptitude questions on probability and combinatorics.
The total time given for the test was 60 minutes which made it a bit difficult.
18 candidates got shortlisted for the interview rounds.
Round 2 (Interview Round)
I was asked to give a self intro by the interviewer.
He then proceeded to look into my resume and asked me to briefly explain my project.He asked me about my favorite subjects and the reason why I'm interested in them.
I was asked the reason I preferred to use the tech stack I used in my projects over the other options.
He asked me to find the minimum number of rotations on a sorted array needed to create the array given.I gave the brute force approach and then optimized the algorithm using binary search.I'm attaching the link to the question on leetcode https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/
I was asked to write the pseudocode on paper and to find the time complexity of my algorithm.Then I was asked some questions on time complexity.
I asked the interviewer about his experience with the firm when he asked if I had any questions.
The interview ended with some behavioral questions.
Round 3 (Interview Round)
The interviewer went through my resume and asked questions based on the skills mentioned.
I had given React.js as a skill so I was asked about the difference between a functional component and class component.I was not able to answer this correctly.
I was then asked some questions on javascript and MongoDB which I was able to answer.
The interviewer then moved on to coding questions where I was asked the Best Time to Buy and Sell Stocks problem in leetcode. I was asked all 3 variations of the problem and was asked to write down the pseudocode for two of them on paper. I was able to answer the questions.
I was also asked to construct the DP table for the Best Time To Buy and Sell Stocks 3 problem .
The final question was to find the cycle length in an array where the array element value indicates the index to which the element is connected.I was able to solve the problem using a hash table but then I was asked to solve the problem using O(1) space which I was not able to.
TIPS
Do not worry if you have not done many projects as they focus mainly on your understanding of data structures and Algorithms and the things you have already learned.
Do not add projects or skills that you are not confident about as It would have a negative effect if you are not able to answer questions based on them.
Read about the company and the role.Find a good question to ask the interviewer.
Keep your cool and try to be relaxed before the interview.Interviewers are there to help you so don't hesitate to ask for help if you feel stuck.
Do lots of leetcode as most of the coding questions asked were directly from leetcode.
Prepare a good self intro and go through some behavioral questions that can be asked by the interviewer.
Do go through some puzzles on geeksforgeeks before the interview as they asked puzzles to some of the candidates.

AUTHOR : Aleena Mary George
Stipend: 1,50,000 per month 
Number of rounds: 4
Numbers of Test Round  = 1
Numbers of Interview Rounds = 3
Round 1:
The first round was an online test with two sections. The first section had about 10 MCQs
and two coding questions. The MCQs had questions from OOPs, DSA, networking,
probability, permutations etc. The coding questions were from graphs.
The second section had two subjective questions. One was what you would do if your
teammate had a sudden emergency and the project was due the next day.
Round 2:
The interviewer asked me to introduce myself. After that he asked me a few questions
based on my resume. He then gave me a few scenarios and asked what data structures I
would use. He and I talked about the advantages and problems of using the data structures I
mentioned. He then asked a puzzle on probability.
(https://www3.nd.edu/~dgalvin1/Probpuz/probpuz3.html) I unnecessarily complicated the
question and could not answer it, but he listened to my approach. Later on, I was asked to
explain something that I thought was complicated in two minutes. I talked about linear
regression. Before going we talked about college and the electives I had chosen for the next
semester.
Round 3:
The interviewer gave one coding question. That was the only question I got in this round.
Two numbers are given as input, you have to divide them and if the answer has a recurring
decimal you have to put that part in parentheses. If the input is 1 and 7 the answer will be
0.(142857). We discussed the algorithm, then he asked me to optimize it. I was then asked
to write the code in any language I was comfortable with. He was very patient and helped
me throughout the process.
Round 4:
The interviewer introduced herself and asked some questions based on my resume. I was
given almost three coding questions in this round. I did not have to write the code only the
algorithm. I tend to remain quiet when I get a question till, I figure out the answer, but my
interviewer wanted to know what I was thinking the whole time. One question was if you
are given a continuous stream of bits, after each bit you need to return true if the current
number is divisible by 5. For example, if the first bit is 1 return false, if the next bit is 0 (10 is
not divisible by 5) return false and if the next bit is 1 (101) return true and so on. In the end
she asked if I had any questions.

Round 1
This round comprised 12 multiple choice questions(I think) and 2 coding questions and a HR
question. Multiple choice questions were from topics like OS, DBMS, OOPS, coding etc. and coding
questions were related on graph topics like minimum spanning tree and shortest path algo. And a
behavioural question was asked regarding what you would do if your teammate has got into a
serious problem and there is a deadline nearby.
In this round, approx. 20 people were selected for next round.
 
Round 2
In this round, he asked a standard Leetcode medium question. I have written the code on paper and
explained line by line to the interviewer. Only one question and this round lasted for about 15
minutes.
 I think 10 members were selected for next round.
Question:- https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/description/
 
    Round 3
In this round, she asked some questions about ReactJS, then she asked me to select a topic and I
chose binary trees. So, she asked a standard leetcode medium question. I have written code and
explained her line by line. She was pretty satisfied with my explanation. Then, she asked a
miscellaneous question which I came across for first time. I was completely blank on how to solve
that problem but my senior told me to not panic when they give a completely new question and told
me to explain all the methods possible and told me to express all my thoughts to tackle the problem.
So, I told her every possible solution to tackle the problem and she helped me throughout and I was
able to solve the problem at the end. And she was quite satisfied with my approach to a completely
new problem. Actually, the problem is not too hard but it seems not too hard when we know the
solution but I saw such type of question for first time and I panicked but I controlled my emotions
and was able to get the solution.
Question-1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-all-root-to-leaf-path-sum-of-a-binary-tree/
Question-2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-divisibility-binary-stream/
 
 
Round 4 
I was asked a standard DSA question and I was able to solve it. Then, he asked many miscellaneous
questions related to system debugging, related to usage of DSA in real life and many more technical
questions. This lasted for about 40 minutes.
Question: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-a-stack-with-find-middle-operation/
TIPS: 
Solve at least 200 dsa standard questions and try to remember the intuition and approach behind
solving each problem not the solution for each problems. Explain every step you are going to do and
explain every step when writing solution on paper even though they are not listening to you. If you
are stuck on a problem explain every possible approach and they might help you. Be confident when
explaining your solutions.

 Round 1:
Consisted of three sections:
Section 1: English Comprehension/ Verbal Reasoning
Section 2: Business Aptitude - Bar graphs, pie charts etc. with data were
presented to us and we had to interpret them and answer questions accordingly.
Overall not difficult, but time consuming.
Section 3: Coding round - Coding round consisted of 3 questions, 2 of which were very simple, the third  question was of medium level difficulty. 
First questions Was to find number of characters in a string  that would remain in the same position  if the string was reversed. 
Second question was; Given an  array of size n, consisting of elements from 0 to (n-1), return an  array A where A[i] is the index of ith element in the input array. Example: input array - [3,1,0,2],  output array - [2,1,3,0]. (Because 0 is in the 2nd index, 1 is in 1st index, 2 is in 3rd index and 3 Is in  0th index)
Third question was a greedy problem.
 
 Round 2:
Interview started with both myself and the interviewer introducing ourselves. The Interviewer then asked a DSA question; How would you implement a stack data Structure using the queue data structure. He then followed up with questions based on the answer that i gave (time complexity of push and pop, optimization, etc.). Then the Interviewer asked about coursework that I did, favorite subjects, and then asked Questions based on my resume (projects, languages, frameworks etc.). Also asked a few questions on DBMS (primary key, foreign key etc.) and one question on Non Deterministic Finite Automata
 
 Round 3:
Very similar to the first technical interview. Interviewer asked about my resume, Languages, projects, favorite subjects. Then moved on to DSA questions. Asked me to Explain DFS and BFS, applications of BFS, pseudocode for finding Nth Fibonacci Number.

Number of Test Rounds  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 1
Number of HR Rounds = 1
Online Test:
The online assessment consisted of three sections, the first one being an English
Aptitude section. This consisted of around 20 MCQ's that tested your understanding of phrases and general comprehension. This was followed by a Business Aptitude section, which tested your ability to draw info from graphs and tables and make correct assertions. These 20 MCQ's were grouped into batches of 4 or 5 which pertained to the same data. The third and final section was the Coding section, which comprised 3 questions where you code programs using basic DSA.
Two of the questions were simply:
"Find the number of negative elements in the list"and
"Given a number, return a number created from the same digits such that you get the lowest magnitude possible (without leading zeroes)"(Example: 1903 wouldoutput 1039)
20 people were shortlisted for the interview round.
 
 ● Technical Interview
The technical interview of mine lasted around 45 minutes, and was taken by a
senior employee who had worked at Wells for 10+ years. I started off with a
friendly introduction, after which he asked me to explain one of my projects. I
proceeded to get into my Web Dev experience as a part of the Tech Teams and
participating in hackathons.
While explaining some backend, he segued into some DBMS, where he
eventually asked me to map out a general scheme for a college management
system. Although we had just started the first week of our new semester and
would be covering DBMS in the following months, I used my experience from
projects to draw up a design he was satisfied with.
He then moved onto my experience with AI, for which I gave a basic overview of
multiple aspects of AI and why I was interested in it. I also ended up giving an in-
depth analysis of the minimax algorithm as it was simple to demonstrate on
paper.
The interviewer was satisfied with me so far and finally decided to give me a DSA
question. It was a simple &quot;Reverse a linked list&quot; question for which I provided the
iterative solution.
The interviewer was happy with the way I had been answering so far, and was
going through my resume and asking a few small questions on things I had
listed. He then decided to wrap things up and gave me a chance to ask
questions. I decided to ask about his experience with the work culture and work-
life balance at Wells, to which he gave me a great answer which I responded
enthusiastically to. A firm handshake and a farewell marked the end of my
technical interview.
 
HR Interview
The HR interview was around 30 minutes, and was taken by 2 senior employees
who had also spoken at the Pre-Placement Talk.
I once again started off with an introduction, and they kicked off the interview with
"Why Wells Fargo?". I had heard good things from seniors (I was particularly
close with a few who had gotten placed there), and even mentioned the work
culture answer I received from my technical round.
They then asked me some questions on my interests, namely Web Dev, AI, and
Game Dev. I told them my motivations behind pursuing and experimenting with
each of them, and even mentioned some of the projects I had worked on and
what I had learned from them.
They mentioned that while they didn' t have much use for Game Dev (obviously),
there was quite a bit of work done with Web Dev and AI, particularly for their
Online Banking sector. I again responded positively and they moved on to test
me with a DSA question.
This question was just as basic as in the technical round:
"How would you evaluate a mathematical expression given as a string?"
(Program a calculator basically).
I explained my initial set-up and thought process well enough that they just
moved on halfway through my explanation.
They then proceeded to ask the classic &quot;Where do you see yourself in 5 years?&quot;,
to which I answered &quot;Ideally still having a stable job, and a Masters as well if I
decide to pursue it&quot;.
They followed up by questioning what plans I had for Masters, to which I
responded that I was uncertain, but would like to dig deep into AI and be a part of
its rapid development. They then followed the same line of questioning and
asked when I would like to pursue a Postgraduate Degree, and if it was even
essential at all if all I wanted to do was research better ways to use AI.
I had answered them extensively, but there seemed to be a misunderstanding
where they thought I would leave the company to pursue my Masters. After they
confronted me directly about my intentions, I quickly clarified my intent to work in
parallel to studying for a Postgraduate if I ever did. I brought up the plan that they
had talked about in the Wells Fargo PPT that supported employees that wanted
to study further.
After that point was cleared up, they decided to wrap up and offered to answer
questions. I decided to ask them about the domains they mentioned in their PPT
and whether we'd get a chance to peek into them all during our internship. I also
inquired about the branch we'd be assigned to for the internship, and whether
we'd get to work with other students as well. They happily answered my
questions, after which I thanked them for the wonderful interview experience.
8 people were finally selected for the internship.
Tips: 
● The Online Test emphasized Aptitude more than DSA. Just be good with general
English Comprehension, and Logic and Data Analysis (Learn to read graphs and
tables well). You should be fine :)
● The technical interview will be dependent on your resume. If you have good
projects they will be willing to ask you about it and allow you to explain what
you've learnt. Otherwise they usually default to DSA questions. (My interviewer
started off by saying that we will mainly be looking at DSA and coding but got
sidetracked pretty much immediately after going through my resume)
● The HR round is basically a formality to see if you'll be a good fit for the
company. Don't answer like a dummy or a psychopath, and you'll get through.
● Be confident in what you know and get your points across clearly. This is hard to
do sometimes so repeat and even clarify points from the interviewers. Be friendly
but professional with the interviewers. Practice answering commonly asked
questions with a friend.
● Try to reference things they might have mentioned before, be it from earlier in the
interview or even during the PPT. This shows them that you've genuinely listened
to them, and are trying to learn/build on top of those ideas or points.
● Always keep a question or two handy to ask the interviewer. They would have
most likely already decided whether to keep you in or not by that point, but it
serves as a good ending note and closes off the interview naturally. On the off
chance they're undecided, it shows you're interested in knowing more about the
company and might help form a good impression.
Resources:
● A good group of friends and seniors who&#39;ll give you feedback as you progress in
your preparation.
● Leetcode for DSA (Personally didn’t use it all that much, but it&#39;s useful to get a
hang of the commonly asked questions (Midcode imo))
● YouTube/Google for anything you want (I basically live on Youtube and watch a
ton of interesting things that I want to look into or try out)

Number of rounds: 4  (1 online test + 2 technical)
Number of Test Rounds  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Number of HR Rounds = 1
 Round 1:
It was mostly based on reasoning(based on graphs, tables, charts, etc.), english and programming. There were three programming questions.
a. The first one was pretty easy map based question. (Though I got stuck due to the
syntax of string stream in C++14. Be careful about which functions you're using
in which version of C++).
b. The next one was again a very simple array based question.
c. The last one was a bit tricky kind of question on sorting/ lexicographic ordering.
The test cases were confusing.
 
 Round 2:
This round was pretty short and the interviewer was quite friendly and conversational. There were no coding questions per se and it was completely resume based. He asked me about literally everything
mentioned in my resumes from my schools, to clubs and associations I'm a part of to the various languages I've mentioned and why. He also asked me about what's the most recent skill I've learnt and also a bit about my project. Some specific questions he asked were:
a. What's the internal implementation of the import statement in python.
b. Difference between arrays and Linked Lists.
c. Various kinds of Operating Systems I used and what made them different from
each other.
d. Difference between Windows and Linux OS.
e. Memory level implementation of Linked Lists.
 
 Round 3:
This was a bit more somber than the previous round. The interviewer asked me to explain to him about my project and asked follow up questions about that. Only one coding question was asked in this round and that was to code up BFS. I wrote the pseudo code and he asked me to explain it to him. He asked me a couple of questions about the algorithm, it's implementation and some specific cases. There were also a couple of behavioral questions as he asked me if I'm always this calm and reserved. Took me a bit by shock, but I managed to answer that. It continued for 5 minutes or so and after that the interview concluded.
Round 4(HR Round):
The round started by the HR asking me to speak about my experience, projects, etc. for
5 minutes straight. Asked me a couple of questions about the implementation of my
project and some intricacies on how it differed from Real life systems. Then he moved to
data structures and asked me to tell him about all the data structures I've studied and
which is my favorite one and why. I told him it was hash maps. Then he asked some
further questions.
● What are the applications of stacks in CS. I told him about how stacks are used
in recursion and then we talked about the winding and unwinding phase of
recursion and how tail recursions are optimized by compilers. I told him about
user stacks and kernel stacks in OS and how they are used during context
switches, etc.
● Then he asked me to delineate the differences between single linked lists and
doubly linked lists. He asked me about the applications of doubly linked lists. I
wasn't sure of that so I asked if I could tell about the applications of SLLs. He
asked me to continue and I told him about the applications of SLLs in disk
storage mechanisms and Garbage collections and we talked a bit about memory
fragmentation, etc.
● Then he asked me about my interests and which areas I would like to work in if I
joined the company. We discussed for about 15 minutes about the roles,
aspirations and policies, etc. After that the interview concluded.
  
Tips: 
● Probably the most repeated one, but don't lie on your resume. They literally ask about  everything  from top to bottom on whatever you've mentioned there.
● Try to chill with your interviewer. They're very keen observers of your behavior and being
too calm, composed and reserved might not be the best of choices. Just be yourself.
● Don't sleep during PPTs. After every round they ask if you've any questions and PPTs
are an excellent source for such questions. Listen to what they've to offer and how it
aligns with your interests. It shows you're actually interested in working there which is a
very important factor.
● Don't be afraid of your opinions or interests. Have convincing arguments for them.

Number of rounds: 3  (1 online test + 2 technical)
Number of Test Rounds  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Round 1 (Test): 
Consisted of three sections:  
1) Verbal Reasoning
2) Business Aptitude (Graph-based questions on stocks)
(The questions under these sections were not that tough, but time is a deciding factor. 
Try to attempt all questions since there is no negative marking for wrong answers.)
 
3)   2 Coding Questions (Medium Level)
14 students were shortlisted for interview round 1.
 
Round 2 (Interview 1):
 
This was a technical round that started with the interviewer’s introduction followed by mine. 
I was asked to speak about something new I learned recently, and then there were some simple questions like applications of a 2D array.  
The interviewer then asked me about my favorite subject, and I mentioned my interest in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). Subsequently, the interviewer asked me several questions to assess my knowledge of DSA (what is a data structure, the common data 
structures used, why should someone learn DSA, circular linked list and its application, heap, AVL tree and its importance, DFS, etc.)
He gave me two short coding questions and asked for their time complexities:
 
1) Given the time find the angle (in degree) between the hour hand and the minute hand. (Just had to write the pseudocode)
 
Input: 9:30               Output: 90
 
Input: 8:40               Output: 0
 
2) Reverse the string without affecting the special characters. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reverse-a-string-without-affecting-special-characters/ (Had to code in front and show the output)
Input: He%$llo!       Output: ol%$leH!
 
He wanted to ask me questions on networking, but since I hadn’t learned about it yet, he did not proceed to ask more about it. After a few questions on STL and OOPS, he asked me if I had any questions for him, and then ended the meeting.
 
Before asking questions on any of the topics, my interviewer was considerate enough to ask me if I knew about it and then only proceeded with the questions. So, if you don't know about a topic don't be tense, just be cool and tell them that you're yet to learn about it. They don't 
expect you to know everything. Just say what you know with full confidence.
 7 students were shortlisted for interview 2.
Round 3 (Interview 2):
 
This round was primarily based on my resume and the projects I mentioned. No coding questions were asked. 
He asked me some basic HR questions like what I knew about the company. 
My interviewer was so chill that I felt like we were just having a fun convo. I didn't have great projects in my resume, just some small ones. But he was so optimistic to give good comments about them too. We discussed about all my projects, and then my thoughts on teamwork. 
We had faced network issues for some time. When it was resolved, he asked me if I had any ideas on how to run smoothly these online interviews and meetings in case of such network issues. 
In the end, he asked me if I had any questions for him. Be prepared with some questions to be asked at this time. It should make them feel that you are really interested in the company. 
This was the final round and 4 students got selected for the internship.
 
Speak to them confidently and openly. Let them know that you are employable in any environment and that you are fit for their company. I believe that beyond just technical knowledge, your attitude matters a lot.

Number of rounds: 3  (1 online test + 2 technical)
Number of Test Rounds  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
 Round 1:
The first round was conducted on the AMCAT platform. The test included 2 coding questions, and MCQs on Logical thinking and analytics, general computer science questions, and English aptitude. The MCQ part was solvable. The coding questions were of moderate difficulty.
 
 Round 2:
In this round, a coding question was given and I was told to solve it within a stipulated time. It was moderately difficult. A system design question was also asked for a cab booking platform.
 
 Round 3:
I was asked to explain my projects in this round. Basic SQL commands were also tested. This was partly an HR round.
  
Tips: 
A candidate must give primary focus to solving coding problems. Leetcode is a recommended platform. The questions which appeared on the interview rounds were mostly of Leetcode medium level.
Make sure to know everything written on the resume.
Try to grasp object-oriented concepts as some candidates were tested on these.
Try to ask a question about the company in the end.
Resources: 
In my opinion, solving more problems will boost the chance of clearing the interview. Leetcode and
Hackerrank are excellent resources for the same. Some theory questions may also be asked from 
course theory. The required concepts can be referred to from GFG.

Number of rounds: 5 ( 1 OT + 3 Technical Interview Rounds + 1 HR Interview) Number of Test Round  = 1
 Number of Interview Rounds = 4 ( 3 Technical + 1 HR) 
       Round 1 : 
 Online test was conducted on HackerRank.
 There were 20 MCQs (with negative marking) and 2 coding questions.
 MCQs were based on some aptitude and some technical questions (oops,SQL, etc.)
 First Coding question was to find if a given number of players can be classified two teams, given the information of enemies and no two enemies can be in the same team.
 Second Question involved strings. Given a string and a value k, we needed to reverse the first k characters for every 2*k length substring. Eg: string= ”abcdefgh”, k=2 output: “bacdfegh”.
 Around 15 students were shortlisted for the 2 nd  round of interviews.
   Round 2 :  
 It was an offline Technical Round.
 I was asked to code the question similar to:  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-all-prime-factors-of-a-given-number/ 
 I got a couple of hints from the interviewer to finally give the efficient approach.
 Then, he asked me to print the right view of a binary tree, after giving the BFS solution he asked if I could think of a recursive solution, I gave a brief idea and then time was up.
 Around 7 were shortlisted for the next round.
   Round 3:  
 It was another Technical Round conducted offline. The interviewer was an alumnus of NITC.
 It started off with my intro and some basic questions based on my projects.
 Then, he asked me some questions on OOPS like what is an abstract class, difference between structures and classes, some real life use cases of classes etc. Then, he asked me a question on SQL as it was mentioned in my resume, it involved a specific function which I wasn’t able to recall so I just gave the idea of how the query would look and he moved on.
Then he asked me two coding questions: First one was to sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s in O(n) time and O(1) space, this I explained with the help of a two pointer approach and was asked the pseudo code.
 Second question was the house-robber question, I wrote the pseudo code for this and then was asked to space optimise it, for the space optimization I told the approach and he was satisfied with it.
 3 were selected for the next round.
   Round 4:  
 It was another offline technical round(around 45 min). The interviewer was another alumnus of NITC.    
 It started off with my intro again and questions about what are my interests.
 He gave me a data modelling question(because I had mentioned data science as one of my interests): Generating a random shuffle from a deck of 52 cards. 
 This round was more conversational wherein I asked him doubts, presented my ideas, he gave hints etc. It was to check how we think and the not our coding skill exactly.
 All 3 moved to the HR round.
  Round 5:  
 This was the HR round.
 She asked basic questions like introduce yourself, about my family, about my plans after B.tech, etc.
 She asked me about my previous interviews, why I chose Arcesium etc.
 She mentioned that we would not be able to choose a preferred job location and if that was fine by me.
 Finally, 2 were selected for the internship.
           
Tips :
 It’s important to keep calm and interact with the interviewer as much as possible, most of them do give you hints and point you in the right direction.
 Even if you are not getting a proper solution, make sure you explain your thought process and where you are getting stuck. Many times it’s just the thought process that they are interested in.
 Important topics in my opinion include: Dp, trees, sorting etc. Difficulty of most of the problems were Leetcode medium type.
 Do make sure that you are able to explain everything that’s mentioned on your resume.
 Going through the company’s website can be helpful especially for the HR round.

Practice a healthy amount of DSA questions (I used LeetCode)
Prepare an introduction for interviews and emphasis things that you know well
Always maintain a smile during interviews and try to communicate as much as possible
Prepare some questions to be asked to the interviewers
Research the company a little before the HR round
Having a project may give you an edge, although I did NOT have any projects

Number of rounds: 5  (1 online test + 3 technical + 1 HR)
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 4
Online test was conducted on HackerRank.
There were around 15 MCQs (with negative marking) and 2 coding questions.
MCQs were based on some aptitude and some technical questions (oops, SQL, etc.)
First Coding question was a very basic question in which we have to find the minimum number of toys we could buy. The cost array and total budget are given.
Second Question was a bit challenging. We had a 2D matrix with only 1s(Chapati) and 0s(Rice). We can flip any row or any column any number of times in any order. We need to flip in such a way that we maximize the count of 1s. 
In my case, 1st code was successful but 2nd code was partially successful (7/9 test cases were passed).
Around 17 students were shortlisted for the 2nd round of interviews. I was one of them.
It was a Technical Round conducted on HackerRank Codepair (around 45 min). 
I was asked to code a question similar to Rearrange a linked list such that all even and odd positioned nodes are together 
I have successfully done the coding part and the interviewer was satisfied with the solution. 
Then, she asked me another question similar to the minimum no. of characters to be added at the front to make string a palindrome. 
She asked me to tell her the basic approach to solving this. I gave her 2 solutions. One was the brute force method and the other was an optimal method. 
Around 8 were shortlisted for the next round.
It was a Technical Round conducted offline (around 1 hour)
There were 2 Interviewers, they were very friendly so I didn’t feel tensed. I had a copy of my resume with me, they have gone through it for a while. Meanwhile, they asked me to introduce myself and asked me about any projects that I have done. As I have no projects, they started asking questions.
Initially, they asked me some questions on OOPS, some were right and some were not. Then, they asked me whether I am aware of DBMS, OS, etc. As I have no knowledge about those, I have said No.
Then they gave me a coding question similar to rotten oranges. They changed the question to factory instead of oranges and told me to write a pseudo code for this.
I took some time and explained my approach. Finally, he told me to code my approach on a piece of paper.
Then they asked some commands for Linux and other technical and some non-technical questions.
Around 4 were selected for the next round.
It was a Technical Round conducted on HackerRank Codepair (around 45 min). The interviewer is an alumnus of NITC.    
He asked me to introduce myself then he gave me a math puzzle to solve. 
I have solved that puzzle by taking a hint. He was friendly and helped me to solve the puzzle. 
Then he gave me a coding question. I have never seen or practiced such type of a question before. I tried and explained my approach, then he asked me to code it. I was successful in coding it. The question was based on stacks. 
Then he asked me some Technical and Non-Technical questions.
3 were shortlisted for HR Round. 
HR Round was offline (around 15 min)
He asked very basic questions like introduce yourself, about our family, about my plans after Btech, etc.
He asked me “Why didn’t you get into previous companies that came?”, “Why Arcesium?”, etc.
He also asked me how many people were using Facebook at that exact time we were speaking. He was not expecting the correct answer, but he wanted to see what are all the aspects we are observing and up to what extent our thinking ability is.
Finally, 3 were selected for the internship.
Try to interact more with the interviewer, whatever approach you know, tell them confidently. They will also help you by giving a failed test case and they will also help by giving some hints.
Actually, I don’t have any projects. I recommend you to have one because explaining the projects kills some time in the interview. They also expect you to have atleast one project.
Be precise when you prepare your resume. They will definitely go through your resume and ask about a few key points.
Try to solve questions from different platforms. Prefer solving medium level questions.
Before attending the interview, just check about the company, what it does, etc. This might be helpful in answering questions in the HR round.

Number of rounds: 5  (1 online test + 3 technical + 1 HR)
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 4
Round 1:Online test on HackerRank
Consisted of Two Coding Questions and MCQs (around 15 questions with negative marking)
Coding Questions: 
The first question was pretty basic, we had to find the maximum number of toys we could buy given a cost array and a total budget. 
The Second Question was challenging, we had a 2D matrix with only 1s and zeros we could flip any row or any column. We can flip an infinite number of times in any order. Flip optimally to maximize 1s and return the count of the maximized 1s. (0 was called Rice and 1 was called chapati). My code passed 8/9 Test Cases.
MCQs covered the topics from Aptitude and some technical questions.
17 students were shortlisted for the interviews.
                    
Round 2: Technical Round on HackerRank Codepair ( 45 min )
He asked me if I knew about exponentiation, but I didn’t so he moved on to the next question. 
I was asked to code a binary search question similar to the First and last position of an element in a sorted array 
I was able to complete the entire code and explain my approach, he was satisfied with my explanation and approach to the question. 
Next, he asked how I would find the end of an array if the size was not given in optimal time. 
We were short on time because the interview started a bit late due to some technical issues so he had to end it fast. 
Around 8 were shortlisted for the next round.
 
Round 3: Technical Round on HackerRank Codepair ( 45 min )
Given a binary tree, I was asked to code a function that updates each node to the value of the node itself plus its left subtree.  
I explained my approach (which was a brute force approach), and she asked me to optimize my approach. I optimized the approach. She was satisfied. 
Then she asked me to code it from scratch and run it on a few test cases given.
4 were shortlisted for the next round.
 
Round 4: Technical Round offline
Two interviewers sat in the room one interviewing me the other just kept to his laptop keenly observing me and possibly verifying what I was saying. 
Asked me to introduce myself, then went on to my resume and asked me to explain the projects that I had mentioned. 
He asked deep questions about React and NextJS and other things that I had put on my resume, some of which I could answer, some of which I could not.  
He asked me about my experience with positions and responsibilities that I had mentioned on my resume what I did recently and details about it. 
Then a puzzle: The 100 prisoners with 100 boxes Puzzle. 
Then he asked about a problem similar to the Max Area of Islands and told me to explain my approach on paper. After I was able to come up with a solution, he modified it a bit and gave me a ‘bridge’ (a '1' that I could put anywhere to connect two islands) and asked me to find the optimal spot to put the one to maximize the maximum area. 
He finally asked me to code my approach on a piece of paper and explain my code.
3 were shortlisted for HR Round
 
Round 5: HR Round was offline 1 on 1 platform ( 15 min )
Simple Questions: introduce yourself, about your family, why didn’t you get into previous companies that came? Why Arcesium and not some MNCs like Oracle? 
He also asked me how many people I thought were using Facebook at that exact time we were speaking. He didn’t want the right answer but wanted to see my thinking process. 
Finally, 3 were selected for the internship.
 
Tips: 
Try to convey your approach/idea to the interviewer confidently. The interviewer will help you by giving some hints. 
Even if you explain a wrong approach, do it confidently. They will correct you and present you with a test case that is not passing your approach and you can build from there, do not sound unsure and leave them no space to correct you.
Do not act too friendly or be too nervous around the interviewer, be in that professional sweet spot.
Try to solve as many problems as you can from different platforms like Leetcode, GFG, etc. Do easy and hard problems but focus on medium ones more.
Being good at Dynamic Programming will help you a lot in round 4, most high-paying companies love to ask DP.
Only mention the projects that you can explain in the resume. Read up on the theory behind the frameworks you used if you don't know them already before the interview.
Write the answers to common questions like Introduction, Weaknesses, and Why that company down before interviews, have a concise answer ready so you can say it without stuttering.

AUTHOR : Sanjay Rajakumar
Stipend: 1,00,000
Number of rounds : 4
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Number of HR Rounds = 1
Round 1 (Online test):
The online test had 2 online questions and around 10 MCQs. The first coding question was about passing a ball in a circle and finding where it ended, The second question was about logical operations (XOR I think). I got partials in both these coding questions. The MCQs were mixed with basic OS questions, debugging, aptitude, and English grammar/speaking. I did not have too much hope after the online round.
Round 2 (Interview 1): 
I was the first candidate for the interviewer. He started off with asking me to introduce myself and went on to go through my resume. He also opened my project and asked a few general questions about it. Later he went on to ask a DSA question. Starting with 1=A, 2=B so on and 27 = AA, 28 = AB so on, find the alphabet representation given a number. I misunderstood the question initially but then later went on to solve it with a stack. He then asked a bunch of general questions like where I see myself in 3 years, my plans for master’s, and my experience with projects and hackathons. I was pretty confident after this round.
  
Round 3(Interview 2):   
The second round started off with a brief intro and he then went on to topics I knew. I was honest and said sorry to some of the topics he asked and then went on to ask a DSA question. The question was to find the largest possible chain from an array of strings where strings form a chain if the last character of a string
matches the first letter of another string. Ex; ring-guy-year-ring form a chain. I started writing the solution immediately but realized that it did not work for many test cases.
He moved on to a puzzle. There were three boxes with the following statements:
Box 1: I have gold,
Box 2: I have gold,
Box 3: Box 2 has gold. There are 2 lies and 1 truth in these statements and only one of the boxes actually had gold. Find out which box actually has gold. This was pretty simple and I answered it. The next question was to find the element that repeated more than n/2 times in an array of n integers. I had to sort it and check for the elements using 2 iterations of binary search. I took some time but I got the answer. He also asked me some basic questions on Inheritance and overriding when I told him that I was familiar with OOPS.
I wasn’t really confident after this round due to the DSA question.
Round 4(Interview 3): 
The interviewer was really nice and did not want to test me on normal DSA and puzzles. He asked me to give a intro and I mentioned that I have been working on DSA. He asked me what all data structures I knew and he was interested in graphs. He asked me to implement a pre-requisite checker for a set of jobs using
graphs. I did not understand why I had to use graphs but he accepted my answer which was using an adjacency matrix. He then gave me a sheet of paper with C code and asked me to find the error. I
did not catch the error exactly but my idea was correct. When he gave me a couple of hints I found out the error, and I feel like he was impressed by this. The next question was on how I would use OOPS to implement a cricket info app. He was expecting a different answer but then moved on to the next
question. He later asked me about my experiences and I feel like he was studying my attitude.
Tips: 
a. I personally felt that the interviewers paid a lot more attention to my attitude and
my honesty. They were really impressed whenever I expressed that I was ready
to learn new things even though I wasn’t aware of certain topics.
b. It’s always better to say NO rather than bluff and not answer questions based on
the topics. Also, it is really important to be thorough with all the skills mentioned
in your resume.
c. PS, it really helps to be strong with DSA and various topics like OS, OOPS, and
the basics of DBMS.
Resources:
a. Leetcode - I followed a series by Neetcode. It’s important to structure the questions you do and follow some sort of roadmap.
Others
I understand how overwhelming the preparation and interview process can be but it’s important to just hang on and keep trying your best. These interviews often require a combination of luck and preparation. Just keep trying and luck will definitely come by.

Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Number of HR Rounds = 1
Round 1 (Online test):
The first round was an online test round wherein we were asked 2 coding questions and
around . The first coding question was about passing a ball in a circle and finding where it ended. For others the question was : Given two arrays,to check whether we can convert them in
such a way that the value at corresponding indexes of both the arrays are equal, if we are
allowed toswap values between the two arrays. The easy question was based on
strings.The second question was an easy question which included XOR operation. I got
both these coding questions.next section included several questions on aptitude, grammar ,maths and logical reasoning.
Around 40 students were shortlisted for the role.
Round 2 (Interview 1): 
The second round was an online interview round. My second round lasted for maximum 20 mins. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and went on to my resume. Since my expertise was backend and web development, I had written extensively about it in my resume. And hence fortunately I was asked about it to. He asked what my favourtie programming language was and proceeded to question my knowledge on that. My respnse was python and he asked me questions on random module in python, and then he asked about dictionaries and asked about other data structures in python. Later he proceeded to ask about my projects. I had faired good in explaining what it was about, and was also able to answer any question thrown at me about the frameworks as well. He even asked about my positions held in the college. 
About 13-14 of us got in Round 3
  
Round 3(Interview 2):   
After that I was asked to wait for about 1, 1 and a half hours, and to be really honest I had given up on my interview, thinking that maybe I hadnt made it to the 3rd round. But yup, I waited and they gladly called me for Round 3. In this roung I was asked a programming question on arrays, and my nervousness got the best of me and I couldn’t answer it. But upon telling him that I was stuck, he helped me and we solved it together. Later again my Resume was searched thoroughly and he asked me about my DBMS knowledge and whats the difference between relational and non-relational databases, and about sqlite and about oracledbs and asked about my projects.
About 8-9 of us got in Round 4
Round 4(Interview 3): 
Round 4 was HR round, to which I was asked behavioural question as well as about the current tech trends. I was asked how would I manage a rude boss, and how would I manage a tem mate who wasn’t cooperative. Later he asked me how I manage to stay up to date with the latest trends in Technology and would I be open to learn new softwares 
Tips: 
● Make sure to know your resume well. Do not and I repeat DO NOT write anything you don’t know
about in your resume 
● You don’t have to strong in DSA, you have to know the basics well though. 
● If your DSA isnt strong make sure to be well versed in any other domain, and do state it in your
resume so that your interview would be directed towards that domain. 
● It is not necessary that your interviewer would expect you to know everything, so you can always
say that you don’t know or you need help.

Number of rounds: 4
 Number of Test Rounds =  1
 Number of Interview Rounds =  4
 Round 1:
The online test consisted of 2 coding questions and around 10 mcq
questions. One of the coding questions was of easy level and the other
was medium level. The medium question was : Given two arrays, we have
to check whether we can convert them in such a way that the value at
corresponding indexes of both the arrays are equal, if we are allowed to
swap values between the two arrays. The easy question was based on
strings. The MCQ questions were aptitude based consisting of distance-
time questions, maths, percentages, etc.
SHORTLISTED:
SERVER TECHNOLOGY: 31
APPS: 25
APPS WAITLIST: 8
        Round 2:
Very chill interview spanning 20 to 30 minutes. I was asked to introduce
myself and he asked me a few follow-up questions. The interview was
centred on my resume and he went through each of my projects, asking
me to explain it. He did not get deep into the technical side of the projects
and just wanted to know how I developed it, and how I planned to improve
it. I was asked an easy coding question: “Given a string of lowercase
letters, find the vowels among them and reverse their order. Eg: hello
becomes holle”. I wrote the answer in python on paper and explained the
logic. He asked me to code it in VSCode on his laptop and run it. At the
end of the interview, he also asked me a few HR questions like how will I
deal with my work if it starts getting repetitive and I don't get new
challenges.
        Round 3: 
This round lasted around 25 minutes and also involved a thorough
discussion of my resume and the technologies I used in building those
projects. SInce I used APIs in my project, I was asked a few questions
about them. He asked me about the different types of APIs, what I knew
about each of them and the types of errors that can occur while using
REST APIs. He also asked me about HTML status codes. I was asked if I
knew JAVA since I did not list it in my resume, and he followed it up with a
few questions on exceptions and threads in JAVA. He asked me an easy
DSA question, to implement a stack using any other data structure. I
implemented it using 2 queues and I had to explain my logic and show how
it works on a few given test cases. We had a long conversation about
working at Oracle, what they do and the skills required at the company. At
the end, I asked him about Oracle Middleware and we talked about it
solely for 5 minutes.
Round 4: 
This was completely an HR round. The interviewer was very chill and the
entire round was more like a conversation. He went through my resume,
asking me about the teams and committees I had been in. He asked me
some situation based HR questions and we discussed a lot on a
hierarchical model within a team. I was asked to give an example of a
technology I would build which would be used in my daily life and also
another one that could be used in any of my non-technical interests. He
asked a few usual HR questions like “ Why Oracle?”, “What do you expect
from the job?”,etc. This round also lasted around 30 minutes.

Tips:
● Research a lot on the company: what they do,what their products are and
prepare a good non- cliche question to ask the interviewer
● Keep conversing with the interviewer. During the interviews, you will enter
a large span of topics which you might not be expected to know in depth
like cloud computing, Cloud services, etc, but having a general idea on it
helps.
● Know your resume inside out. In addition to knowing the technical aspects,
be confident in explaining your project to the interviewer.
● For the assessment tests, practise a few general aptitude questions like
distance-time, simple and compound interests, work done, discounts,etc. A
little practice and you can easily crack all of them.
● Practice interview coding questions on geeksforgeeks (Yes, they do
repeat).

Number of rounds: 3
 Round 1:
It was a casual round, the questions being mostly focused on my
resume. I was asked to write the code to perform an email validation in
javascript. It was followed by some relatively easier questions about
machine learning as there was mention of it in my resume. Questions
such as what algorithm would be best in clustering the data into four
groups, what activation function is applied on the output layer of
classification deep learning networks, about partitioning data into train,
test and validation splits. Nothing much was asked from DBMS as I had
informed beforehand that I was not quite familiar with it. Very few
questions were from the DSA side. I was asked about different tree data
structures. To conclude I was asked to write the code to print the pattern
of an inverted cone.
        Round 2:
I was asked to code the solution to classic problems such as finding a
loop in a linked list, random number generator and two sum. Some
questions from OOPS followed. The diamond problem, definition of
virtual method, abstract class being some of those.I wasn’t able to
answer all of those. From there on it was solely behavioural questions
along the lines of what my biggest challenge as a programmer was, how
I would manage a teammate who is not contributing etc.
        Round 3: 
He inquired in detail about my projects. Subsequently there were a lot of
HR questions. How I would handle situations such as a team member
dropping out of the team, a deadline that has been pushed forward,
managing a position that requires an authoritarian attitude. Other
questions included what my biggest achievement was, what I would
have done had I not got that, my biggest breakthrough movement, my
strengths and flaws, innovative ideas I have come up with etc.

Tips:
Avoid exaggerating your skills in resume.
Be frank in admitting answers to questions you do not know
Prepare beforehand on what you would say if asked to describe
yourself, your biggest ordeal, how you overcame it etc..
Skim through the mostly asked interview questions. They do ask the
exact same questions from before and it is expected of you to answer
that.

Number of rounds: 5
 Number of Test Rounds =  1
 Number of Interview Rounds =  3
Number of HR Rounds =  1
 Round 1:
• We were asked 2 coding questions, along with questions on logical reasoning,
and English proficiency.
• I was able to solve one out of the 2 coding questions (both of which were
array problems of upper medium level).
• There was no negative marking, and the rest of the questions were solvable
with 12th grade mathematics and aptitude.
        Round 2:
• The interviewer was really friendly and started off with asking me to introduce
myself, which I did and I casually steered the conversation to my projects, as I
was much more confident in it than DSA.
• He asked me to elaborate a bit on the projects that I did (both of which were
AI focused)
• He then moved on to ask me a simple sliding window question which was to
find the length of the longest substring with at most 2 distinct letters, and
asked to me write down the pseudocode for it as well.
• After I solved that, he asked me a variation of the Einstein houses riddle which
I was only able to solve partially, so he let it slide.
• I was also asked about BSTs and how insert and deletion is done, given an
array of numbers to insert, and asked me to write down the pseudo code for
inorder traversal.
• He then talked to me a bit more about cloud computing and the hosting
methods which I used to host my projects.
        Round 3: 
• The second interview went in a similar way to the first, but was a bit more DSA
focused.
• It started of with me introducing myself, and him asking a small puzzle.
• Then he asked me how I’d implement an autocomplete feature, i.e., an
algorithm that can suggest a few words given the first few letters. I suggested
a Trie based approach and it seemed to be what he wanted. I was also asked
to write down the pseudocode.
• The next question was an array generation problem. The problem went as
such:-
1. You’re given 2 arrays with repeating elements.
2. Let’s assume a number repeats x times in array 1, and y times in array 2
3. You are to create a third array in which this number repeats max(x, y)
times.
4. If the number is present in only one of the arrays, it should repeat the
same amount of times.
• I took a few seconds to think about the question, and to clarify I asked him
about the time & space complexity he expected and he said there is no
limitation and I can suggest what I feel is right.
• At first, I suggested a hash map to store each count of the letters and he didn’t
seem pleased with it, so I thought a bit more and suggested a binary search
with two pointer approach. At first he thought I did it wrong, but as I explained
it again, he accepted my solution.
• The interview ended with him asking if I had any questions, to which I asked
what tech stack that would be used and what the common roles of interns will
be, to which he replied that Application interns would be more involved with
CRM than their Server Tech counterparts, and that we would be using Java for
almost all our services.
Round 4: 
• This round too was a technical round in which I was asked questions from
literally every topic.
• It started off with my introduction again, and the interviewer seemed to be
interested in my projects, much more than the previous rounds. He asked me
a lot of questions, about what I used to create the projects, when I started
learning about AI, and a lot of other things.
• He then told me a bit about Oracle’s upcoming roles in AI as well.
• He then proceeded to the question, the first one was to debug a C code, which
I suggested a solution, but it turned out not to be completely correct, but he
accepted it.
• He then asked me what I know about SQL, and I told him about the use of it
inside my projects and my current knowledge level. He asked me a simple
question on joining 2 tables, and I wrote down the answer, he then proceeded
to ask a bit more about SQL which even he didn’t expect me to answer.
• Then he asked me a simple DSA question which was to delete the repeating
elements from a sorted linked list, which I suggested a two pointer approach
and he accepted
• He then asked a OOPS question which was to implement a cricket score
tracking application, which when score gets updated, updates not just the
overall match score, but also the players individual scores as well. I suggested
a solution which he said was not the most optimal and scalable but was good
enough.
• This interview also ended with him asking for any questions, to which I asked
more about the AI partnership he mentioned, and if an intern would be given
any AI related projects, to which he assured me there are chances, but it
depends on a lot of other factors as well.
Round 5: 
 • This round lasted just 5 minutes, with the HR, who asked me about how the interview was, and any   complaints that I had (except for the fact that the whole process lasted 12 whole hours), which I   replied well apart from that, I had no complaints and most of the doubts that I had were     answered by the previous interviewers.
• Out of us 25 interviewed for applications, 5 were finally selected.

Tips:
a. Practice a lot of leetcode medium problems, preferably follow a question sheet like
neetcode ( I’ve linked below )
b. Most of the puzzles and logical questions that were asked came directly, or were slight
modifications, from the gfg, so do refer them.
c. Don’t boast on your resume, as most of the interviews were based on our skills, and
don’t mix up knowing SQL from school with DBMS, as oracle is a SaaS company and they
will drill you with DBMS questions if you say you know it.
d. Either have a good array of projects which you can talk a lot about and answer their
doubts and questions, or be really thorough with DSA, as from the experience of those
with me, those without a lot of projects were asked much harder DSA problems than
those with projects.

Number of rounds : 3
Number of Test Round  = 1
Number of Interview Rounds = 2
Round 1:
The first round was an online test round wherein we were asked for four sections. The first section of the test included basic English questions like subject-verb agreement, reading comprehension, and vocabulary-based questions. 
The second section of the test included basic mathematical aptitude questions like distance, averages, and probability-based questions. 
The third section was based on OOPS and basic database management systems. 
The four sections had MCQs based on BSTs, AVL Trees, and arrays. We had a negative 0.25 for every wrong answer. Overall, the test covered basic English, mathematics, and programming concepts. Revising DSA, the basics of DBMS, and OOPS will help a lot. Around 40 students were shortlisted for the role.
Round 2:
The second round was an online interview round. My second round lasted for 35 mins. The interviewer asked me to introduce myself and went on to my resume. He asked me about a project on JavaScript and resources management using OOPs. He asked me to explain the overview of my projects and why I chose the same. He also asked me why I didn't host my website. To conclude my second round, the interviewer asked me a basic time and distance puzzle to which I explained my approach first and then gave the answer. Overall, the second round was mostly around my resume so be sure of what you mention.
Round 3:
After the second round, I had to wait around 15 mins for round 3 which lasted for around 45 mins. The second interviewer again started with the project and asked me how I implemented certain functions. He went on to question me on the basic data structures and gave me an array of questions to solve. He didn't expect me to code it but I had to open Notepad and explain my logic. I started with the brute force approach and then went on to optimize the same. He was satisfied with the answer and asked me other coding questions. I explained the logic and coded the function on Notepad. He didn't ask me to optimize my solution. He asked me if I had any questions for me to which I asked basic prepared questions like what do you expect from an intern in your team etc. After round 3, I was told I’m done for the day and they will let me know the results through TnP. A few people had 4 rounds of interviews but I didn't have a HR round. 
Finally, 9 of us were selected for the role of Server Technology engineer, and by gods grace, I was one of them.
TIPS:
●  Prepare answers for questions like tell me about yourself, where does your interest lie in the field of CS
●    Do a lot of leetcode and puzzles. It's never too late to start.
●      You can tell the interviewer if you’re stuck or have no idea about what he is asking. They usually help you and it's    absolutely ok to ask for some time to come up with a logic for coding questions.
●      Gfg and interview bits help. Read through them for basic OS, DBMS, and OOPs concepts. Also, be thorough with S4   subjects and your project.
●    Have an open mind and interact positively with the interviewer.

ROUND 1:
It was a proctored online test that was held on their own platform. We have to solve around 80 questions in 100-110 minutes.
Questions were divided into different sections and each had their own time limit. It comprised of Logical reasoning, Contextual communication, and General aptitude and OOPS, DBMS, OS, and DSA. OOPS questions were in JAVA. So, it’s better to have a basic idea of Java.
No negative marking.
ROUND 2:
This was the first interview round. Due to some network issues, there’s a delay from my side. The interviewer was so friendly. He stayed all the time and he gave me some time to settle things up and asked me to cool down.
It started with an introduction about himself and then the question “Tell me about yourself.” and then a dive into Resume.
Since I mentioned some projects, there was a detailed discussion on them.
He then asked what I know about the company.
He then asked me about the Hourglass puzzle (Puzzle 27 | (Hourglasses Puzzle) - GeeksforGeeks). As far as I can remember, I was asked another puzzle too.
He asked some basic questions on OOPS.
After that, Interviewer asked me to open a text editor. He then gave the basic LeetCode questions – Two sum, 3 sum. He then asked me about a problem on BSTs.
I just need to show my code and explain it and there isn’t any need of running it.
At last, He asked me if I was having any questions for him. I asked him about his role and work environment.
ROUND 3:
This round was mostly on OOPS. It started with the conceptual questions. He then asked me to open a text editor and asked me to implement some questions related to that. This discussion lasted for 15-20 mins.
He then asked me the “Find the fastest 3 horses” puzzle (Puzzle 9 | (Find the fastest 3 horses) - GeeksforGeeks). I was correct up to a point, but the interviewer pushed me to solve the question. He helped me to answer it.
He then asked me a typical popular LeetCode question (I don’t remember that). It was a sorting problem. As I practiced mostly from LeetCode during preparation, it helped me during these interviews.
ROUND 4:
This round started with a series of HR questions. It’s better to prepare beforehand so that you don’t fumble with your words.
He then asked me if I know any who is currently working in Oracle and what he/she said about their work experience in Oracle.
The interviewer was really friendly. He noticed that I’m feeling tense. He asked me to turn off my cam and cool down.
And finally small problems – Factorial and Fibonacci series.
With this the interview ended. This round was around 15 mins.
 
TIPS:
BLUFF.
BE CONFIDENT.
If you don’t know …accept it. The interviewer will help you.
Speak out what you have inside.
Practice on LEETCODE.
Be prepared with all the OOPS, DBMS concepts.
Make sure you are well-versed with all the DSA concepts.
Look up puzzles from Geeks for Geeks.
Practice HR questions. Be confident to face it.
Make sure you have an idea about the company like what does it do… Etc.

Round 1:  ONLINE TEST
This was the only online test that we had. The test was divided into 5 parts where they asked MCQs regarding aptitude, English skills (Comprehension, grammar, etc.), and various CS topics. There were a lot of questions focused on all kinds of trees including binary trees and AVL trees. They also asked many questions regarding various HTTP status codes where you had to choose an appropriate one for the scenario mentioned. Some of the questions were lengthy and the time was extremely limited, so I had to guess some of the questions at the end. They followed a similar format last year too. So, I would recommend focusing on these topics mentioned (in Geeks4Geeks or something) and not wasting time during the test.
 
Final Shortlist
1.  ST – 40
2.  APPS – 30
 
Round 2: FIRST INTERVIEW
He started asking me questions regarding Computer Networks like what is a router, switch, and IP address and so many questions which I mostly have not answered or answered very vaguely about what I know about them since we learn about them in semester 6. I told him that these are not yet completed for us and that he just wanted to know what I know about them. In this part mostly he answered himself and I listened. Next, he asked a coding question
https://dev.to/kavitagupta972/hackerrank-coding-challenge-3p5j
 
I was not able to solve it completely but I explained brute force and a bit of improvement for that. Then he asked me to explain the project I wrote in my resume and asked a few basic questions (This helped me to kill some time). Most of the time he is very interactive and made me comfortable. Mainly I did not understand whether he is satisfied with my answer or not.
 
Round 3: SECOND INTERVIEW
I did not expect I would be qualified for the next round but I was. This round was good mostly I answered all questions. The interviewer started asking me so many basic C language questions. 
Then he asked me a simple puzzle https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-3-calculate-total-distance-travelled-by-bee/
Then he asked me to write code to find the second last element in LinkedList.
 
Round 4: FINAL INTERVIEW
This round was almost totally HR for most of the people (5- 10 mins). But for me, it was about 30 mins. 
He thoroughly went through my resume and touched each and every part of it (like skills, and projects). He spent so much time on my resume (Be careful with what you write)
Apparently, I felt he is not satisfied with my project (he felt they can easily be done). 
He asked me a coding question
https://LeetCode.com/problems/find-first-and-last-position-of-element-in-sorted-array/
I haven’t done this in LeetCode before, so I took time to solve it and he helped me to optimize the brute force method. He finally asked me a coding question - Detect loop in LinkedList.
 
 
Tips:
Keep coding throughout the vacation, one or two problems a day from hacker rank or LeetCode.
Ensure that you have a project mentioned on your resume (that helps to kill time, but also be thorough with what you have written)
Take your time to answer questions during interviews, don’t blurt out answers if you aren’t sure of it. Make it very interactive.
Do some research about the company and its motto before going to the interview.

The interview rounds were online.
Round 1: Online test
The test was MCQ based. It had different sections and each section was timed. It had a range of questions from different topics like DSA, DBMS, Operating Systems, aptitude, general English, grammar, etc. 
The most important part to be taken care of during this test is time management.
 Round 2: Technical round
The interviewer asked me to share my screen and open an online compiler. He asked me a few coding questions. The questions were mostly based on strings and arrays. The interviewer also asked a few theoretical questions. The last question he asked me in this round was to design an algorithm for a problem that he gave. He was really friendly. I remember him asking me to cool down seeing my anxiety!
Round 3: Technical round
The interviewer asked me to code linked list operations. I had to write an entire program that involved insertion and deletion at different positions of the linked list, reversal, etc. A few questions on BST were also asked.
 
Round 4: Mix of Technical + HR round
A logical question was asked, and I was asked to code. He asked me about the projects which I had done earlier. He also asked me whether I had done any group projects before, to which my answer was no. He asked a few questions about my general interest in computers and the reason why I wish to join Oracle.
 
 
TIPS:
 
DSA is the key. Try practicing as many questions as possible. 
Since the interview was online, we had to show our rough work through the camera. 
Theoretical questions were mostly from OS, DBMS, and DSA. Don’t be overstressed. 
Even if you are not able to get the exact solution, try sharing your thoughts and ideas with the interviewer. They may guide you and help you with their ideas. 
Be confident. Believe in you and your efforts. 
They may ask questions about the projects you mention in your resume. So it is important to have good knowledge about them before going for the interview. 
Refer to GFG and other related sites for company-specific questions. 
Interview diaries proved to be helpful during my preparation.

She started by asking which language I am most proficient with, and then gave me a simple probability question - You have 3 friends in Calicut and I am in Delhi, the probability of one telling the truth is 2/3 and a lie is 1/3, so find the probability that it is actually raining in Calicut. Then she gave me a Hackerrank link which had a SQL question (because I had mentioned it on my resume) and one question on a string to remove "k" consecutive repetitive letters from the string, such that the final string returned has no "k" consecutive letters. 
Round 4(Interview 3): 
The third and final round started with explaining my project mentioned in the resume and I had to convince him how it worked and what would each part of the project do. Then there was one linked list question where I had to find the (n-7)th node by traversing only once. In the end, he asked a puzzle - There are 10 bags where each contains 'n' nodes, out of which 9 bags have coins weighing 1gm and one bag has coins weighing 0.9gms. We have a weighing scale on which we can put any combination of bags only or coins only or mix, but we can check the weight on the scale only once, not more. I have never seen this puzzle before but I got it, and it can be found in geeks4geeks. - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-bag-of-coins/.
Tips: 
Make a plan at the beginning of the vacation, and try to follow it as much as possible. I was trying my best to complete 5 Leetcode questions every day, including 1 Easy, 2 Medium, and 2 Hards (This one was really tiring to complete so would often end up doing only one hard a day). Choose a language early on and stick with it don’t keep shifting since you need good practice in one, plus doing a project in that language would also help. Next on the list would be doing theory subjects belonging to S5. Learn about operating systems, DBMS, Object-oriented programming, and computer networks (from Geeksforgeeks and Youtube) and revise S4 theory topics. Towards the end when time permits, topics which you feel you are weak in DSA can be practiced by taking Qs from the LoveBabbar excel sheet.

Every company in this vast industrial world has its own way of filtering and selecting its candidates for employment. While we cannot pinpoint the exact procedure that each of them follow, what we can do is provide you with the advice sought from the ones who have successfully tackled their tests. 
Our articles will consist of the experiences of the very own students/alumni of NITC who have worked or are presently working in various companies. Most of the companies' pages will include articles from both interns and full-timers, providing an insight into the difference (or similarity) in their procedure accordingly. 
We hope you find Interview Diaries helpful. Happy reading and good luck!
